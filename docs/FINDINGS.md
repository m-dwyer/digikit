# Digitakt II / Digitone II — findings

Current targets are **Digitakt II OS 1.16** and **Digitone II OS 1.11**. Older
sections were written against DT2 1.15C and are kept for their history; where a
later section corrects one, it is marked **[C]**.

This file is the entry point into the lab notes for the Digitakt II / Digitone
II reverse-engineering work; the notes themselves live in `docs/findings/`,
one file per topic, in the chronological order they were written (later
sections often correct earlier ones — read a file top to bottom). Start with
the topic closest to what you're doing, or grep across all of them with
`rg . docs/findings/`.

Evidence classes used below:
**[V]** verified by running it here · **[D]** documented by prior research, not
re-checked · **[O]** open / nobody has established this.

| file | covers |
| --- | --- |
| [`01-container-and-patching.md`](findings/01-container-and-patching.md) | Scope and the 2.01 firmwares, the ELE3 container format, integrity, packing, the version gate, recovery, what is patchable, the 1.16 rebuild, flash caves that survive a cold boot, cavefind |
| [`02-machines-and-parameters.md`](findings/02-machines-and-parameters.md) | The ColdFire machine dispatch, the descriptor and parameter tables, display names, the type-7/PLACEHOLDER clone work, the permission check, the SRC slot model, CFADE, XSLICE on 1.16 |
| [`03-ui-and-panel.md`](findings/03-ui-and-panel.md) | Panel chords, the UI queue, MACHINE SEL, timer-rate behaviour, the GUI/replay disagreements |
| [`04-coldfire-dsp-link.md`](findings/04-coldfire-dsp-link.md) | The periodic DSPI2 frame, the frame capture, the frame link on 1.16, the machine type reaching the SHARC, the mirror/SRC-parameter path, why DSPI2/DSPI1/FlexBus show no note-trigger or sample-data signal in a bounded run, the natural per-track kit-load-and-refresh event and why timed captures miss it (`--pre-instrs`), the DSPI2 tail past the 0x802-byte payload (real but kit-load-explained, not a trigger), the DM(0x261a10) SPI-slave driver control block, and the note-scheduling consumer `FUN_40139b78` -- why no capture has ever reached a running RTOS (a live-intro snapshot delivered PIT2/3 anyway, and the DSPI2 forcing loop re-entered its own handler, fixed); Lane I1: `tools/dt2_reach_running.py` reaches and snapshots a genuinely running RTOS with kit/pattern loaded (`running.snap`), a real panel TRIG now reaches the full note chain end to end, PLAY still does not within a bounded run, vector 191 still needs forcing even once running, and `tools/sharc_capture_run.py` resumes `running.snap` directly |
| [`05-sharc-isa-and-decoding.md`](findings/05-sharc-isa-and-decoding.md) | The SHARC+ instruction tables from the public manuals, the run of Type-NN decode corrections, the selache cross-check, the Selache round trip, parcel order |
| [`06-sharc-engine-and-startup.md`](findings/06-sharc-engine-and-startup.md) | Startup and boot tracing, the interrupt vector table and SECI dispatch, the per-frame render chain, per-track machine dispatch and its remap table, the audio task and ring conversions, the voice record contract, the effect stages and master, the 6-tap polyphase voice render loop verified end to end; older text on the machine-type consumer, the SRC page and CFADE; the unresolved machine-type change-detector write-target probe |
| [`07-emulator.md`](findings/07-emulator.md) | Emulation, display, DSP bring-up, making it run, the performance work, correct-speed playback, the serial console, boot, speed measurements, the QEMU verdict, two task counters, SHARC voice-render tooling (post-init snapshot, watchpoints, survey) |
| [`08-hardware-and-ghidra.md`](findings/08-hardware-and-ghidra.md) | The MCF5441x identification, eDMA, the MMIO hook, Ghidra tooling, RTTI/code seeds, Version Tracking, functions Ghidra misses |

| [`11-sharc-cross-image-comparison.md`](findings/11-sharc-cross-image-comparison.md) | Bounded structural comparison of the DT2 1.16, DN2 1.11, and DN2 1.10E SHARC images, plus a byte-level check of the six wavetable stages and their shared reciprocal helper |
