    -> (m, ev, st, pc, inq, at) where `at(addr, fn)` registers a further
    begin==end code hook and `inq` is the UART8 receive queue (a deque of
    ints; append to it to feed the firmware input).

    Pass ``deferred_components=('timers',)`` when the snapshot was saved with
    a ``Timers`` component.  Build restores guest state, UART, and eDMA before
    its legacy kick, then exposes ``ev['claim_checkpoint_component']``. Create
    timers against ``m`` and call ``ev['claim_checkpoint_component']('timers',
    timers)`` before ``spin`` or ``run_until``. The claim also registers it in
    ``ev['checkpoint_components']`` for the next save. Unclaimed saved state
    fails at execution rather than silently running with a fresh timer clock.

    idle_yield: raise vector 32 (reschedule) every N passes through an idle
    spin (bra.b $self); 20000 is the long-standing value.

    isa='scoped' pre-scans MAIN OS for the FF1/MOVEC addresses and hooks only
    those, instead of running a Python callback on every instruction. This is
    what dspboot.run's fast path uses, so it is also what produced the
    snapshots -- resuming with it keeps the run faithful *and* is ~3x quicker.
    isa='global' is the belt-and-braces version: it also catches those opcodes
    outside the MAIN OS image, at the cost of that per-instruction callback.

    unblock=True force-satisfies every sem_pend whose count is <= 0, so the
    wait takes the primitive's non-blocking fast path. Without it every task
    but the idle one parks forever waiting on a device event -- DSP, panel,
    MIDI -- that no emulated hardware will ever raise. dspboot already does
    this for the one DSP transport semaphore; this is the same trick applied
    to every wait, and it is what makes the draw task actually draw.
    It does change semantics: nothing ever really waits, so inter-task
    ordering is not the hardware's. `unblock_except` lists semaphore objects
    to leave alone, for waits you want to drive properly instead -- the intro
    frame semaphore 0x43131200 is the case that matters, since satisfying it
    is what makes the animation run unpaced. The progress screen's frame
    semaphore (`display_sem`) is always excluded too, since the PIT3 ISR
    that posts it is modelled.

    `unblock` never satisfies a pend from any of `recheck` -- call sites
    that re-check a condition after the wait and loop, so satisfying them
    spins instead of sleeping. It also stops satisfying the intro frame
    semaphore by itself once the intro's exit path is reached, which covers a
    run that executes the intro; `recheck` covers a run resumed from a
    snapshot taken after it.

    softfloat=True runs the firmware's float routines natively instead of
    emulating them. It is OFF by default: it is bit-exact but changes
    instruction counts, and too much in this project depends on a resumed run
    matching the run that made its snapshot. Turn it on for watching, leave it
    off for coverage, differential or checkpoint work. 93% of executed instructions were soft-float, so this is
    the difference between ~2M and ~20M instructions/sec. It is bit-exact --
    only the fast path is intercepted and everything else defers to the real
    routine (see emu/softfloat.py) -- so program state evolves identically.
    Instruction *counts* do not: a run with it on is not comparable to one
    without, so turn it off for coverage or differential work.

    bitmap=True does the same for Bitmap::setPixel/getPixel, the top cost once
    the float work is gone. `on_pixel(x, y, val)` then receives every pixel
    drawn, which is how the frame capture observes drawing -- so callers must
    not also register their own setPixel hook.

    `edma` models eDMA channel 35, the UART8 transmit ring. It defaults ON
    because without it the firmware's console-enqueue routine spins forever
    waiting for ring space and boot cannot get past the intro -- see
    emu/edma.py. Unlike the softfloat/bitmap HLEs this is a hardware model,
    not a shortcut, so there is no faithful configuration with it off.

    real_sleep=True makes `0x40128c7c` a real sleep instead of a no-op, by
    letting `unblock` block at sleep_pend instead of force-satisfying it.
    It requires that DTIM1 is being delivered (see emu/dtim.py) or the
    priority-3 job worker will block forever.

    srtrap=True routes exception entry through guest code so the frame
    carries the CPU's real condition codes. Unicorn's m68k never reports
    computed flags through `reg_read(UC_M68K_REG_SR)`, so the frame we used to
    build carried a stale CCR that `rte` then installed over the flags of the
    code being resumed -- see Machine.install_srtrap. Default off because the
    fix is not finished: it delivers interrupts and runs the ISRs correctly
    but the boot stops progressing.

    dsp=True backs the `0x8C000000` coprocessor port's ready line, without
    which the priority-3 job worker wedges on its first transfer -- see
    emu/dsp.py. Default off because it is new, in the same spirit as
    softfloat and bitmap defaulting off.

    weakptr=True neutralises the two branches in `weak_ptr::lock` that send
    the main task into the terminal loop at `0x4012d2fa`:

        40188b40  6714 beq.b $40188b56  ->  4e71 nop     (a0 is NOT null)
        40188b50  660a bne.b $40188b5c  ->  600a bra.b   (d0 is NOT zero)

    Both branches contradict the memory they were taken on -- measured at the
    hang the control block reads 0x4509e3f0 and the use count reads 2 -- so
    this is the condition-code corruption of HANDOVER section 10 showing
    through, not a firmware decision. It is a DIAGNOSTIC, not a fix: it papers
    over one symptom of the exception model and leaves the cause alone.

    It is a two-byte memory write applied before `emu_start` is ever called,
    so it adds no hook (HANDOVER warning 2) and no translation block can be
    stale. Without it the main task burns the CPU forever -- 252,977,319 of
    300M instructions in a `bra.b` to itself -- and the message loop stops at
    153. With it there is no terminal loop and the loop reaches 168.

    slc=True sets the image-resolved cached EXT_CSD SLC-status byte to 1.
    `profile.slc_status_predicate` is the firmware's tri-state check: it
    returns 1 for ok, 0 for unset and -1 for error. The main task displays
    `MMC NOT IN SLC MODE` when its caller's `cmp.l #1,d0` fails. The address
    differs between builds (0x4fe49198 on the reference Digitakt image and
    0x4e531198 on Digitone), so it must never be a shared literal.

    The host write models state normally established before these snapshots;
    it is opt-in and fails clearly if the image has no resolvable predicate.

    Measured from postintro.snap over 60M with weakptr=True: the modal dialog
    goes away and the panel settles on the real main screen (project name,
    tempo, encoder labels) instead of `Loading...`; both job workers start and
    then block properly in the RTOS wait at 0x4000165c instead of one wedging
    in the coprocessor spin; and channels=(3, 1) stops faulting -- it runs to
    the limit where it used to die at 55.6M with `unhandled vector 257`.

    sdgate=True models the board loopback that gates storage: port C bit 3
    follows port D bit 4, which is what `0x4011fe60` spends ten iterations
    checking. Without it that gate returns 1 on its first pass and
    `0x400cf216` skips the eSDHC card init entirely -- measured from
    boot40M.snap over 120M instructions, the driver is never entered and not
    one eSDHC register is ever touched. See emu/gpio.py.

    esdhc=True models the SD/MMC controller at 0xFC0CC000 and a minimal eMMC
    behind it, which is what `sdgate=True` exists to reach. It carries the
    whole card identification sequence -- CMD0, CMD1 until OCR bit 31 sets,
    CMD2/3/10/9 for CID and CSD, CMD7 select, CMD6 for HS_TIMING and
    BUS_WIDTH, the CMD19/CMD14 bus test, CMD16 block length, and CMD8
    SEND_EXT_CSD -- and card init runs to completion instead of spinning.
    See emu/esdhc.py.

    It needs `sdgate=True` to be any use: without the gate the driver is never
    entered and the model is never touched. With both, PRSSTAT goes from
    36,988,314 reads to 7. CMD18 and CMD25 bulk data moves through SoC eDMA
    channel 59. An absent backing image reads as zero-filled media; writes
    are retained in a sparse card overlay and checkpointed so later reads
    and resumed runs see them.

    Both default to True now. Without them the firmware's SD bring-up never
    runs, the storage-ready flag stays 0, and every block-storage read
    returns -1. With them on, both builds reach MAIN_OS_RUNNING under
    tools/bootcheck.py --verify: Digitone's display module initialises for
    the first time, and Digitakt's cold boot creates 9 tasks instead of 5,
    including the priority-6 Main OS task at entry 0x40032f5a. Digitakt
    reaches MAIN_OS_RUNNING both with and without them, so turning them on
    does not regress the previously-working build. Pass sdgate=False and/or
    esdhc=False to get the old unmodelled-storage behaviour back.

    ``ssi0_request_hz`` opts into the separate SSI0/eDMA48/50 event source.
    The explicit rate is mandatory because the board's external SSI_CLKIN
    frequency is not recovered. ``ssi0_legacy_upgrade=True`` is the only way
    to add it to an old checkpoint: the restored guest TCDs are validated,
    the fresh SSI clock begins at that checkpoint boundary, and subsequent
    saves carry both a topology manifest entry and an independent component.
    It is never silently added to legacy snapshots.

    condition can be written as a hook, because passing `count` to emu_start
    makes Unicorn install an internal per-instruction hook to decrement the
    budget, and that defeats its fast dispatch path. Measured over the same 40
    rendered frames: 8.03s with `count=250_000` against 4.45s with no count,
    a 1.8x difference for identical work. Measured again in 2026-09-13 on the
    settled main OS rather than the intro, the same comparison is **7.6x**
    (2.0M instructions a second against 15.5M) -- the penalty grows with the
    amount of translated code in play, so treat 1.8x as a floor, not a figure.

    The cost is in `count` itself, not in how often emu_start is called --
    over the same 100 frames, count=20k (1308 calls), count=500k (53 calls)
    and count=1e9 (1 call) all land within 3% of each other.

    `timeout_ms` bounds how long a single call may stay inside Unicorn, so a
    caller that also has to honour a pause or stop flag keeps responding even
    when the firmware stops doing whatever the hook was watching for. Without
    it, a hook-only stop condition hangs the caller the moment the firmware
    stops meeting it -- which is exactly what happens when the intro ends and
    nothing draws any more. A timeout return is not distinguishable from a
    hook return, so the caller re-checks its own condition and calls again,
    which is what a loop does anyway. Pass 0 for no bound.

    Unlike `count`, a timeout is free: over those same 40 frames, uncounted
    measures 4.45s and uncounted with a 0.5s timeout measures 4.43s. `count`
    installs a per-instruction hook; a timeout only arms a timer thread.

    Stop only from a hook that has already moved PC past the current
    instruction -- the setPixel HLE writes PC = return address, so it
    qualifies. Stopping from a plain code hook leaves PC on the hooked
    address, and resuming re-enters the same hook immediately: the run then
    spins making no progress while appearing to iterate.

    """Bound a run without `count=`, by counting basic-block entries.

    `count=` is what makes emu_start stop on an exact instruction, and
    Unicorn implements it by counting every instruction, which breaks TB
    chaining. Measured on this firmware, same machine, same hooks, same stop
    mechanism: 2.0M instructions a second counted against 15.5M uncounted, a
    7.6x tax. That is where the emulator's speed went -- a cProfile of the
    running configuration puts 99.5% of wall time inside emu_start and under
    0.5% in every Python callback in this project combined.

    A block hook can bound a run instead, and it leaves the fast dispatch
    path intact. Two things it cannot do exactly:

      * The hook says a block was ENTERED, not how many instructions ran, so
        the count is entries times a fixed instructions-per-entry figure.
      * The run stops at the first block boundary at or after the target, so
        a timer fires up to one basic block late (about four instructions
        here) rather than on the exact instruction it was due.

    So this changes the instruction stream, and therefore the boot digest.
    It is opt-in, never the default, and nothing making a determinism or
    pass/fail claim should use it. See spin's `fast` argument.

    Two earlier designs failed here, and both failures are worth keeping:

    It summed block `size` in BYTES and divided by a bytes-per-instruction
    ratio. But `size` is the size of the TRANSLATED block, not of what
    executed, so a block entered and branched out of early still counted its
    whole length. Entries do not have that problem.

    It re-measured that ratio every sixteen steps from a `count=`-ed step,
    and smoothed the sample in at 0.25. Two things made that a one-way
    ratchet. Deadline stepping routinely asks for a step of 1, 3 or 11
    instructions when two timers come due together, and `step` was the
    divisor, so a single translated block's byte count swamped it. And the
    budget MULTIPLIED by the ratio, so a bad sample lengthened the next run
    instead of shortening it. Successive calibrations read 3.8 -> 16.2 ->
    849 -> 17145, after which one nominal 62,377-instruction step consumed
    1.07 GB of blocks -- roughly 200M instructions -- in 435 seconds while
    crediting the emulated clock its 62,377. The GUI showed 1% of real time
    and a frozen panel.

    Both are now structural rather than guarded. The budget DIVIDES by
    `per_block`, which is never below one instruction, so `left` can never
    exceed `step` entries however wrong the figure is: it can make a step
    short and the timers choppy, it cannot make one run away. And there is
    no calibration to go wrong, because measurement showed there is nothing
    to calibrate -- see PER_BLOCK.

    """Run in chunks. -> (pc, executed, stop_reason).

    Pass `pits` (an emu.pit.Pits) to run to each timer deadline exactly
    instead of to a fixed chunk. `chunk` is then unused: the step is
    whatever remains before the next PIT is due, so an interrupt lands on
    the instruction the timer was due at. Without this, the same run from
    the same snapshot gives different fault counts and different display
    callback counts for nothing but a different chunk size. Only timer
    deadlines may subdivide timer-stepped execution; arbitrary subdivisions
    are unsupported. Servicing the timers is part of this loop when `pits` is given, so do
    not also service them from `on_chunk`. `async_events` contains additional
    exact-deadline sources such as Ssi0Dma. They share the timers' absolute
    instruction clock but retain independent checkpoint components; the
    legacy Timers checkpoint topology is not changed.

    A `Pits` holds its deadlines as absolute instruction counts, and `done`
    here restarts at zero on every call, so successive calls with the same
    `Pits` resume from `pits.now` rather than rewinding the clock. Without
    that, a caller that spins in a loop -- the GUI does -- gets timer ticks
    during its first call and silence afterwards, because every deadline is
    already in the past-that-is-now-the-future.

    In `pits` mode `instrs` is a floor, not a ceiling: the loop finishes the
    deadline step it is on, so it returns having executed up to one timer
    period more than asked. That is deliberate. It makes one call of N
    instructions and ten calls of N/10 execute the identical instruction
    stream, which is what lets the GUI and the measurement harness agree.

    Accounting is of what actually executed, not what was requested. When a
    vector has no handler, `install_exceptions` stops the run from inside
    the hook: emu_start returns normally, having executed nothing, and a
    loop that credits itself the full step races to the instruction budget
    in seconds and reports a run that never happened. PC zero is Unicorn's
    known end sentinel: a normal return there reports ``pc zero`` and credits
    none of the incomplete step (a conservative lower bound), and does not
    service timers.

    tick=True injects a vector-32 (scheduler) trap at every chunk boundary.
    That is NOT what the hardware does and NOT what dspboot.run does -- it
    forces a reschedule in the middle of whatever code happens to be running,
    and a resumed run then diverges from the run that produced the snapshot
    (the init task never reaches its own flag test at 0x400cf384). Ticking
    idle spins, which build() does, is the faithful mechanism. Left available
    only for deliberate "shake it and see" experiments.

    Every chunk boundary costs a `count=` argument to emu_start. That is far
    more expensive than it looks: measured on this machine with every hook
    installed, counted execution runs at 2.0M instructions a second against
    15.5M uncounted, a 7.6x tax, and a cProfile of the running configuration
    puts 99.5% of wall time inside emu_start. An older note here put the cost
    at ~1.8x; that was wrong.

    `fast=True` buys that back with `_FastStepper`, which bounds each step
    with a block hook instead. It is opt-in because it costs exactness: the
    instruction count becomes an estimate, and a timer fires up to one basic
    block late rather than on the instruction it was due. That changes the
    instruction stream and so the boot digest. Use it for interactive running
    -- the GUI does -- and never for a determinism or pass/fail claim.
