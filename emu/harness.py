"""Unicorn m68k harness for running real Digitakt II ColdFire code.

Unicorn's m68k core has gaps that matter here. All are handled below:

  * FF1.L (0x04C0-0x04C7) is not implemented. Left alone, boot stalls at 444
    distinct code addresses; emulated, it reaches 36,474. Biggest single win.
  * MOVEC with Rc=0x009 does not fault -- it aborts the process (SIGABRT).
    It must be intercepted in the code hook, before Unicorn's decoder sees it.
  * m68k exceptions are never dispatched through the vector table.
  * `rte` is surfaced as intr number 0x100 (QEMU's EXCP_RTE) and must be
    implemented by hand.

See docs/findings/07-emulator.md for how each was found.

        Unicorn's m68k keeps the condition codes in TCG's lazy `cc_op` form
        and `reg_read(UC_M68K_REG_SR)` returns only what was last *written* --
        never the computed flags. Proved directly: after `tst.l d0` with d0
        non-zero, SR still reads back the seeded value with Z set. So an SR
        read is stale, and an SR *write* built from one installs wrong flags.
        An identity `reg_write(SR, reg_read(SR))` around a `tst.l`/`beq` flips
        the branch.

        That is not a hypothetical. Every delivered interrupt used to corrupt
        the flags of the code it interrupted three times over: `raise_vector`
        pushed a stale SR into the frame, `Pits.service` wrote a stale-derived
        SR back, and `rte` restored the stale frame value onto the resumed
        instruction stream. It is almost certainly the whole of HANDOVER
        section 10 -- "a `bgt` at 0x40111070 taking opposite branches from
        identical PC, A7, D0 and A0" is what a corrupted Z looks like.

        The CPU can compute what we cannot read: `move.w sr,d0` executed by
        the guest returns the true flags. So exception entry goes through this
        trampoline instead of straight to the handler:

            move.w  sr,d0         ; the TRUE SR, flags materialised by the CPU
            move.w  d0,$6(a7)     ; -> the frame's SR slot
            andi.l  #$f8ff,d0     ; clear the old interrupt mask
            ori.l   #level,d0     ; set S and this source's level
            move.w  d0,sr         ; a guest-side SR write, so the CCR survives
            movem.l $0(a7),d0     ; restore d0; MOVEM has no CCR effect
            lea.l   $4(a7),a7     ; drop the scratch longword
            jmp     handler.l

        `move.w d0,sr` is the trick that makes this faithful: the low byte of
        the value it writes is the CCR the CPU itself just produced, so the
        handler starts with the interrupted code's flags, exactly as hardware
        leaves them.

        The handler address and the level word are patched per delivery.
        Returns the trampoline address, also kept on `self.srtrap`.
