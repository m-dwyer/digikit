"""Resolve firmware addresses from the image itself, instead of hardcoding
them per build.

Every address dspboot/longrun/gui/panel needs used to be a literal constant,
good for exactly one firmware: Digitakt II OS 1.15C. A second firmware (same
ColdFire SoC, same bootloader, same RTOS, different application build --
Digitone II 1.10E) runs under those constants today and produces silent
garbage: no error, just five minutes of boot into a blank panel, because every
hook lands on the wrong instruction.

Proof the addresses are derivable rather than fixed: five RTOS entry points
(entry, task_create, task_start, sem_pend, pend_b) sit at byte-identical
offsets in both 1.15C and 1.10E -- the RTOS is linked at a stable base
regardless of what the application above it looks like. Everything else moves
between builds by anywhere from a few bytes to several hundred KB, because the
application code before it changed size. So the five RTOS entry points are
FIXED (checked in as literal addresses, verified against opening bytes at
resolve time so a firmware that does NOT share this RTOS build fails loudly
rather than silently), and everything else is found by what it looks like or
how it is reached from something already resolved:

    * a `jsr <fixed-address>` call site (Xrefs, XrefShape)
    * a big-endian abs32 literal embedded in the instruction stream at a
      known offset from something already resolved (Operand, Operands)
    * a byte sequence unique in the whole image (Opcode)
    * a masked signature: N reference bytes captured from the Digitakt image,
      with any embedded absolute address in [0x40000000, 0x40400000) --
      i.e. anything that looks like an inlined pointer INTO the loaded image,
      which relocates between builds -- wildcarded out, then searched for a
      unique match in the target image (Sig)

Verified against two extracted MAIN OS images (both load at 0x40000400):
Digitakt II 1.15C and Digitone II 1.10E. See docs/ for the resolution table;
this file is the implementation, and the reference bytes below are the only
firmware-specific literals it contains besides the five RTOS addresses.

Nothing else about either firmware is checked in. In particular the masked
signature bytes are captured from the DIGITAKT image and pasted here as
literals -- NOT read from disk at runtime -- so this module, and everything
that imports it, works with no firmware image present at all.

REQUIRED symbols (boot cannot progress without them): entry, flash_read,
pend_call, completion_sem, depack_copy, task_start, sem_pend. An unresolved or
ambiguous REQUIRED symbol raises SymbolResolutionError naming exactly which
symbol(s) and why, at `resolve()` time -- not five minutes into a run.

Everything else is OPTIONAL: diagnostic (task_create_sites, call_sites,
idle_spins), late-boot/GUI (panel_diff, fb_front, fb_back), or the UI-trace
hook points (queue_send, ui_queue, ui_key_dispatch, view_offer,
view_activate, view_close, view_closed_mark, view_request_pop, view_sweep,
ui_tick_inc, ui_tick_counter). An unresolved
OPTIONAL symbol is simply None on the Profile; every caller of one must
degrade gracefully (install no hook) rather than crash -- see dspboot.py,
longrun.py and panel.py for the pattern.

    depending on where the compiler put it -- which is what keeps it working

    their addresses being required unique, because these products reuse
    short labels: `TRIG` is both a page button and the stem of `TRIG 1`,
    and `ENCODER A` appears in two different tables.

    Only the NUL that TERMINATES an anchor is required, never one before it.
    The compiler tail-merges string literals, so a short label is commonly
    the suffix of a longer one -- `SRC` is the last three bytes of
    `PAGE SRC` -- and demanding a leading NUL matches nothing at all.

    Resolves to the address of entry 0. Must match exactly once.
