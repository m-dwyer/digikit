"""Boot the thing and watch the panel.

A live view of the Digitakt II's 128x64 OLED, driven by the real firmware
running under Unicorn. The emulator runs on a worker thread and writes into a
shared framebuffer whenever the firmware calls Bitmap::setPixel; the UI thread
just samples that framebuffer on a timer. Nothing here reimplements the raster
-- every lit pixel is one setPixel call the firmware actually made.

There are TWO screens and this window has to switch between them, because the
intro and the main OS draw by different routes. Measured, over the same build:

    boot400M.snap, intro running    setPixel 616,823   panel buffer     17 lit
    postintro.snap, OS running      setPixel       0   panel buffer  2,373 lit

The intro draws through `Bitmap::setPixel`, so `on_pixel` is the right source
for it. The main OS composes straight into the firmware's own framebuffer and
never calls the intercepted primitive, so after the handover the source has to
become `emu.panel.read`. Showing setPixel throughout is what made this window
sit on the intro's last frame forever while a complete user interface was
rendering in RAM -- see HANDOVER warning 6. The switch happens at INTRO_DONE,
the same point the timers are released.

    uv run python -m emu.gui [snapshot]

--patch-machine installs the experimental eighth machine (PLACEHOLDER) into
the running emulator's machine list. Bare, it applies all nine parts of the
patch (list, dispatch, group, name, rank, permit, hint, pertype, clone);
--patch-machine=list, =dispatch, =group, =name, =rank, =permit, =hint,
=pertype, or =clone applies just one, and a
+-separated combination (--patch-machine=list+dispatch) applies exactly
those, for bisecting a boot failure. An optional :N suffix on the parts
value (--patch-machine=list:6)
sets the 8th list entry's value, default 7, to distinguish "eight entries is
too many" from "the value 7 is the problem". This patches guest memory in
the running emulator only -- it modifies no file on disk and is not a
flashable patch.

--machine=NAME:SHORT[:CLONE_OF[:POSITION]] overrides the new machine's
names, cloned descriptor and display position (see
tools/machinepatch.py's MachineSpec); without it the default spec
(Placeholder/PLC, cloned from type 6) is used.

--ips-at WHEN:N (repeatable) changes the timer rate to N instructions per
emulated second at instruction count WHEN (e.g. --ips-at 80M:18.72M after
boot); the GUI then runs slower than real time if the emulator cannot
keep up.

--post-intro-ips N sets the timer rate applied when the intro hands over;
default 18720000 (4x INSTR_PER_SEC); 0 keeps the default rate; ignored when
--ips-at is given.

tkinter only, no third-party GUI dependency. Note Homebrew's python@3.14 does
not ship tkinter; uv's managed CPython does, which is why pyproject pins 3.12.

# It is expensive: deadline stepping needs `count=` on emu_start, and that

# there is nothing to win by making BUDGET bigger than responsiveness wants.
# The GUI defaults to spin(fast=True), which drops `count=` entirely; --exact
# puts it back for comparison against bootcheck. See longrun._FastStepper.
