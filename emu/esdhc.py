"""The eSDHC controller and the eMMC behind it.

`0xFC0CC000`, 16 KB, PBC0 slot 51 (RM chapter 25). Reached only when
`build(sdgate=True)` satisfies the board loopback of `emu/gpio.py` -- without
that the driver is never entered at all. See HANDOVER section 6b.

What the firmware does with it, from the driver map:

  * `0x4011fe10` writes CMDARG then XFERTYP -- **writing XFERTYP issues the
    command** -- and then blocks on semaphore `0x44e26f38`, returning the
    status word `0x44e26f1c` that the ISR is supposed to have written.
  * `0x401208fe` reads blocks with CMD18, `0x40120ae4` writes with CMD25.
  * `XFERTYP[DMAEN]` is never set and DSADDR/ADMASAR are never referenced: the
    controller's own DMA is unused, and bulk data moves through the SoC's eDMA
    with `SADDR = DATPORT`.
  * Init ends with the eMMC **bus test**, and it is a real handshake, not a
    magic number. `0x40120242` writes `0x5A` to DATPORT under CMD19
    (BUSTEST_W), then CMD14 (BUSTEST_R) must read back a word whose low byte
    XORed with `0xA5` is zero (`0x401202c6`). `~0x5A == 0xA5`: the card returns
    the inverse of whatever the host sent, so the model inverts the captured
    pattern rather than hardcoding the constant.

Modelling notes that cost time:

**Reads are served from the backing store, not a read hook.** Every register
this model owns is kept up to date in guest memory as state changes, so an
ordinary read just works and no hook runs on the hot path. Only two addresses
carry write hooks -- SYSCTL, whose self-clearing bits have to be cleared, and
XFERTYP, which is the command trigger.

**`uc.mem_write` from Python does not fire write hooks** (HANDOVER trap 13),
so the model updating its own registers cannot recurse into itself.

**A write hook fires BEFORE the store lands.** Reading the register back from
inside one gives the OLD value, and anything written from inside it is then
overwritten by the store that is still to come. So a write hook must use its
own `value` argument, and a register whose value has to be *corrected* is
handled on READ instead -- which is what SYSCTL's self-clearing bits do here.
Getting this wrong looks exactly like the model not being installed: the INITA
spin stays at 36,988,467 reads and nothing else changes.

**Self-clearing bits are why the driver used to hang.** `SYSCTL` bit 27 INITA
sends 80 init clocks and clears itself; bits 24-26 RSTA/RSTC/RSTD are software
resets that do the same. Backed by plain RAM they read back whatever was
written, and `0x4012001e` spins forever -- measured at 36,988,467 reads.
