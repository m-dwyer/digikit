"""One definition of the ColdFire<->SHARC DSPI2 frame link.

This used to be scattered: `tools/sharcframe.py` (frame capture),
`tools/machinecheck.py` (frame-word addressing), `emu/dspi2.py` (the eDMA/DSPI2
transport model) and `docs/findings/04-coldfire-dsp-link.md` each carried a
partial, independently-phrased copy of the same facts. This module is the one
place they live now; the other three import from here instead of restating
them. See `docs/findings/04-coldfire-dsp-link.md`, "The ColdFire tells the
SHARC through a periodic DSPI2 frame", "eDMA and DSPI transfer inventory" and
"The mirror index to TX frame map, and the 17-word header" for how each fact
below was established.

Two layers:

- **Transport** (SoC hardware, not firmware-specific): the DSPI2 peripheral's
  register block, eDMA channels 28/29 and their completion vectors, and the
  fixed 2,748-byte full-duplex frame size. Same on every image because it is
  wired into silicon and the RTOS-level driver shape, not chosen per build.
- **TX frame contents** (firmware-specific): where a track's fields sit inside
  the frame once it's built. The per-track stride, header size and mirror-index
  map are the same on every Digitakt-family image seen so far (`docs/findings/
  04-coldfire-dsp-link.md`), but the frame's *guest address* and the per-device
  real-payload length are not -- they come from `tools/framelink.py`'s
  per-image, SHA-256-keyed profile (the DSPI2-frame analogue of what
  `emu/symbols.py` does for RTOS/boot symbols: resolve from the image rather
  than hardcode one build's addresses for every build). `tx_base_for()` /
  `rx_base_for()` below pull the guest address out of a resolved profile
  instead of a third hardcoded copy; `TX_BASE_DT2` / `TX_BASE_DN2` are the
  known values for callers that already know which device they're on and have
  no image to resolve against (`tools/machinecheck.py`'s pure-function tests,
  which build addresses with no snapshot or image present).
