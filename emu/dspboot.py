"""DSP bring-up experiment: extends flashboot.py with instrumentation for the
ColdFire<->SHARC transport at 0x40128c7c and task_create/task_start tracking.

Key finding (see docs/findings/07-emulator.md, "Blocker 1 (cleared): the
transport is a mutex+semaphore wrapper, not an RPC"): 0x40128c7c is NOT "send arg, wait for
reply" in the sense of an RPC round trip with payload -- it is a
lock-mutex / kick-transfer / wait-on-completion-semaphore / unlock-mutex wrapper,
and the argument pushed by every one of the 4 call sites (0xF4240, 0x3E8, 0x64,
0x2DC6C0 -- 1000000, 1000, 100, 3000000) is a **microsecond timeout**, written
into a hardware register at 0xFC074004 that is *not* read back by the ColdFire
side afterwards. The real completion signal is a semaphore object at 0x44e4d69c:

    0x40128c7c  lock mutex @0x44e4d6a4                (400015a0)
                (first call only: install ISR @0x40128c4c at vector 97,
                 enable INTC sources 0x21/0x1d, init semaphore @0x44e4d69c to 0)
                write timeout -> 0xFC074004
                write control word 0x841b -> 0xFC074000   (kicks the transfer)
                jsr 0x4000141a  (sem_pend on 0x44e4d69c)  <-- BLOCKS HERE
                unlock mutex (tail call into 0x400016d2)

    0x40128c4c  (the completion ISR the real hardware would fire)
                ack/clear @0xFC074003, clear @0xFC074000, sem_post(0x44e4d69c)
                via 0x4000155c -> 0x400011ee

0x4000141a (sem_pend) has a **fast, non-blocking path**: if the semaphore's
count field (offset 0) is > 0, it clears it and returns immediately without
ever calling the scheduler (`trap #0`). Also, critically, its return value in
D0 is *discarded* by every one of the 4 callers (D0 is immediately overwritten
right after the call) -- so callers never inspect a "successful transfer"
value from 40128c7c itself, only from other paths (checked separately below).

So instead of firing interrupts (tried before, ~330 addrs gained -- likely
because it raced the scheduler / hit paths that expect real ISR side effects),
this patches the semaphore field directly, right before the pend call, so the
fast path is taken. No interrupt dispatch, no scheduler re-entry, no rte.

Patch point: PC == 0x40128d08 (the `jsr $4000141a` instruction itself) ->
write 1 into the 4 bytes at 0x44e4d69c before letting it execute.

# task's idle loop) is exactly this shape. Found a SECOND one blocking
# progress at 0x400cf3e0 (a different task/thread's idle point, reached
# right after it creates 4 more tasks at prio 5/6/7/8) that our original
# single-address HALT hook never fed a timer tick to.
#
# CORRECTION (session 3): 0x400cf3e0 is NOT another task's idle point. It is
# where the prio-1 init task parks after finishing, reached by the `bra.b` at
# 0x400cf3f4 that ends its main loop. Ticking it changes nothing -- it is a
# *ready* task at priority 1 and the scheduler correctly keeps picking it. It
# sits there because everything above it is blocked, which before the
# raise_vector trap-frame fix meant everything, forever. See
# docs/findings/07-emulator.md, "Making the emulator actually run --
# session 3". Scanning for 0x60FE is still the right
# generalisation; the reading of this particular address was wrong.

# --- depack copy-loop safety valve -----------------------------------------
# There is a second, unrelated aPLib-style depacker embedded in MAIN OS at
# 0x4012ab70 (distinct from the bootstrap's 0x80000432, and from the flash
# section-table format entirely -- this one runs at DSP-bring-up time on
# in-memory buffers). One invocation, call site 0x400cf2d2 (source a static
# address *inside the already-loaded MAIN OS image itself*, 0x402489b4 --
# not flash- or DSP-reply-dependent data), decodes a match/copy token whose
# length comes out enormous (into the millions) and the resulting byte-copy
# loop at 0x4012acb8-0x4012acbe never terminates within any reasonable
# instruction budget.
#
# Verified NOT a Unicorn MVZ/MVS decode bug (see docs/findings/07-emulator.md,
# "A red herring that turned out to be correct behavior, not a bug", and the
# session log): tested mvz.b/mvs.b in isolation, register and (a0)/(a0)+
# addressing, all matched expected 68k semantics exactly. The bad length is
# either a real bug/edge case in this second depacker's gamma-code decode
# that has never been exercised on hardware with this input, or (more likely)
# this call is not meant to be reached via the code path our semaphore patch
# takes -- i.e. a knock-on effect of *skipping* the real scheduler yield
# rather than a hardware-response question at all.
#
# Rather than fully reverse the gamma2 length code to chase that down, this
# clamps the copy count if it is absurdly large right where the loop reads
# it (0x4012acb8, after the final `sub.l d0,d2` adjustment) -- WITHOUT
# touching the bit-reader (d1) or source pointer (a0) state, so every other
# token in the stream still gets parsed from the correct bitstream position.

    a resumed run behaves identically to the equivalent straight run. Without
    that the resumed run would miss flash HLE, the semaphore patch and the
    scheduler tick, and silently diverge.
    sdgate: install emu.gpio.SdGate, modelling the GPIO loopback the cold-boot
    continuity check reads. esdhc: install emu.esdhc.Esdhc behind it, using
    profile.sd_status as its drv_status (None if unresolved, in which case
    Esdhc falls back to its own module default). Both default to True: without
    them the firmware's SD bring-up never runs, the storage-ready flag stays
    0, and every block-storage read returns -1. With them on, both builds
    reach MAIN_OS_RUNNING under tools/bootcheck.py --verify -- Digitone's
    display module initialises for the first time, and Digitakt's cold boot
    creates 9 tasks instead of 5, including the priority-6 Main OS task at
    entry 0x40032f5a. Digitakt reaches MAIN_OS_RUNNING both with and without
    them, so turning them on does not regress the previously-working build.
    Pass sdgate=False and/or esdhc=False for the old unmodelled-storage
    behaviour.
    machine_out: if given, receives 'm' (the Machine) and 'st' (the stats
    dict) before emu_start is called, so a pre_start hook can see both.
    card_image: path to a +Drive image built by tools/plusdrive.py. Passed
    through to emu.esdhc.Card.from_file, which mmaps it read-only; writes
    during the run go to the in-RAM overlay and the file itself is never
    modified. Only meaningful when esdhc=True; ignored otherwise."""
