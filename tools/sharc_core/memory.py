    Application code uses unaliased DM pointers such as ``0x26968c`` whereas
    the boot stream is keyed at ``SW_ALIAS_BASE + 0x26968c``.  Keep an already
    mapped direct address (notably external memory and MMRs) unchanged; only
    retry an unmapped low address through the alias.

    SHARC+ byte address space is the chip's one universal address map: "[a]ll
    physical memory can be addressed using the byte addressable memory space"
    and "[d]ata access of all sizes can be done using byte address space"
    (SHARC+ Core Programming Reference, out/refs/sharc-plus-prm, "Byte
    Address Space Overview of Data Accesses", p.7-4, extraction page 221);
    for a plain direct address (no DAG modify/index arithmetic -- Type14a/
    14d's own ``addr`` field, as opposed to ``Ia+mod``) the accessed byte
    range is always ``[address, address+width)`` unscaled, and only the
    opcode's own size suffix -- (bw)/(sw)/unqualified/(lw) -- picks WIDTH:
    "[t]he address space does not select the memory word size for byte
    addresses. Accesses to byte addresses obey the size of the opcode ...
    not the address space" (p.6-3, extraction page 187); Table 6-2 "Legal
    and Illegal Accesses to Byte Space With or Without Address Scaling"
    (p.6-10/6-11, extraction pages 194-195) and Table 6-3 "Operand Addressed
    in Non-Byte Space or Byte Space for Extended Precision Accesses" (p.6-13,
    extraction page 197) scale a MODIFY's own offset/index by the access
    size when the I-register is in byte-addressed space, never the base
    address of a direct/absolute access like this one. So which of the two
    physical locations a DM pointer resolves to -- raw, or the loader's
    ``SW_ALIAS_BASE``-relative mirror -- is a property of the address alone,
    not of which width happens to be asking: WIDTH governs only how many of
    those bytes this call needs, checked separately below. Deciding the
    family from a WIDTH-wide presence probe (as this function used to) lets
    two different-width accesses to the identical address disagree about
    which physical location it names -- reproduced directly (a 1-byte write
    then a 2-byte read at the same fresh low address;
    tests/test_sharc_memory.py's ``test_family_choice_is_width_independent``)
