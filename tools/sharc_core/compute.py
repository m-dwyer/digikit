"""Compute operations (ALU, multiplier, shifter, multifunction) and their
application.

The four operation-body modules below this one in the layer order --
compute_alu (cu=0), compute_mult (cu=1, plus the MRDATAMOVE encoding and
the two multiply-accumulate-into-MRF patterns), compute_shift (cu=2, plus
_shift_immediate) and compute_multi (multifunction and short compute) --
hold one handler function per operation, in tables keyed by the field bits
that select it. This module keeps ``_compute`` as the single entry point:
field extraction, and dispatch through those tables.

Three encodings are undocumented in both public sources this project cites
(PRM and PGR; see each handler's own docstring for the page-by-page
absence): multiplier opcode 0x10, shifter opcodes 0x14 and 0xb0, and the
cu=3 reserved unit's only observed opcode 0xd6. Each is still decoded (so
the instruction walk does not desync) with its result and flags left
Unknown; tests/test_sharc_compute_table.py's cross-check against
tools/sharcspec/compute_table.json treats exactly this set as expected
gaps, not as table entries the JSON has to justify.

Four field patterns are checked directly on the raw field bits, before the
mf/cu decomposition the rest of this module dispatches on, and so are not
folded into the general (cu, opcode) tables even though two of them
(0xb4, 0xb0) reuse that same cu/opcode bit layout:

- The MRDATAMOVE encoding (PRM Table 18-29) is a different field layout
  entirely (direction/opcode/rn packed under fixed bits 22:17, not
  cu/opcode/rn/rx/ry), so it cannot share the general table's key shape.
- The two multiply-accumulate-into-MRF rows (opcode 0xb4/0xb0 at cu=1)
  are checked by field pattern *before* the mf bit (22) is even read, so
  they also match when mf=1 -- i.e. they take priority over multifunction
  dispatch for that field pattern. Moving them into the post-mf cu=1
  table would silently stop intercepting that mf=1 case. This also means
  multifunction categories 0 and 1 are unreachable dead encoding space
  (shadowed by the MRDATAMOVE check above, which is checked first): a
  fact of the original if-chain's priority, preserved here rather than
  "fixed", since fixing it would change behaviour.

Moved (and reorganised, not rewritten) from tools/sharc_trace.py.
