"""Replay a tools/sharc_capture_run.py capture into the real SHARC audio
task, from a post-init state.

    uv run python tools/sharc_replay.py dt2-1.16 CAPTURE.dt2cap \
        [--frames N] [--out OUT.wav] [--report OUT.json] [--freq HZ] \
        [--sample-len N] [--force-command N]

For each captured DSPI2 frame, in capture order:

1. **Report the frame's own content**, at the per-track offsets
   docs/findings/04-coldfire-dsp-link.md's TX frame map already establishes
   from the ColdFire's own build code (`FUN_4002d438`/the vector-191
   handler): machine type at byte offset `0x94 + 2i` and the two derived
   flags at `0x73c + 2i` / `0x75c + 2i`, for tracks 0-15. This does not
   depend on where -- or whether -- the payload lands on the SHARC side
   (see point 2): it is read straight from the captured bytes, the same way
   `docs/findings/04`'s own `tools/sharcframe.py` experiment read them.

2. **Delivers the transfer at its real hardware address and lets the
   firmware do the rest (lane G1, 2026-09-26)**, instead of poking a
   confirmed-by-execution but firmware-internal buffer directly. Lane G1
   traced the SPI-slave receive DMA's own descriptor-list ring
   (`tools/sharc_harness.py`'s own module note above
   `dma_landing_address()`: `FUN_1c7bd4` builds it at DM `0x2641b0`/
   `0x2641cc`, ADDRSTART fields pointing at `command_word`'s own two
   ping-pong instances, `0x264220`/`0x265220` on DT2 1.16 -- the SC58x/
   2158x Hardware Reference's own Descriptor-List Mode layout,
   out/refs/adsp-2156x-hwr Table 27-10) and confirmed the SAME address from
   `render_frame`'s (`FUN_1c2b24`) own consumer side: its `M10` (saved from
   its incoming `R12` argument, `command_word + (shift<<12)`) is the SOURCE
   of its own 512-long-word (2,048-byte) copy into `RX_BASE` (`0x2558dc`,
   still the confirmed-by-execution buffer `FUN_1c2b24`'s own per-track
   decode reads -- now understood to be a WORKING COPY render_frame makes
   every frame, not the landing zone itself).

   So this tool now calls `sharc_harness.write_dma_transfer()` (writes the
   captured frame's own TX bytes -- 16-bit-unit byte-swapped, see that
   function's own docstring for why -- at whichever ring `command_word_
   shift_src` is NOT currently pointing at) and `sharc_harness.
   drive_dma_completion()` (calls `FUN_1c77b4`, the SPI service's own
   registered completion callback, with an event code that has its own
   bit 5 set -- the one bit that function's own 9 instructions act on --
   toggling the ping-pong shift onto the buffer just written, and re-arming
   `sharc_harness.COPY_GATE_ADDRESS`, a second, still-open gate lane G1
   found guarding render_frame's own companding-copy block; see that
   module's own section note for exactly what is, and is not, traced about
   it) before every frame's own `call_frame_collect_all()`. It no longer
   pokes `RX_BASE`/`command_word` directly at all -- both are now filled by
   `render_frame`'s own execution, from the transfer this tool delivers at
   the real hardware address.

3. **Drives the real audio-task call chain**, the same one
   tools/sharc_harness.py's `render_frames()`/`call_frame()` already proved
   reaches render_frame (block_handler -> command_dispatch_fn ->
   cmd_handler_3 -> render_frame -- docs/findings/06's "Frame call path"),
   with `FRAME_PATCH_TABLE` (that module's own hypotheses for the stops an
   almost-empty synthetic frame hits) via
   `sharc_harness.call_frame_collect_all_with_hits()` -- every stop the
   frame call passes is recorded (`per_frame[i]["stops"]`), not only the
   first, so a replay's own report is a full list of what each frame
   depended on; a breakpoint at `0x1c60a2` (`FUN_1c60a2`, the machine-type
   change detector docs/findings/06's Lane E2 found unreached from a
   synthetic frame) is installed on every frame, so `per_frame[i][
   "fun_1c60a2_hits"]` answers, with a real hit count rather than an
   inferred one, whether a real, correctly-delivered transfer ever reaches
   it.

   **The command word itself is no longer a separate poke.** It comes from
   whatever the delivered transfer's own header (TX byte offset 0,
   docs/findings/04's "Frame content: a header written at +0x00") resolves
   to once `render_frame`/`command_dispatch_fn` read it back -- `cmd` in
   this tool's own per-frame report is `frame_command(frame.tx)` (or
   `--force-command N`'s override, now applied to the TRANSFERRED bytes'
   own header before delivery, not to `command_word` after the fact) purely
   for describing what was sent, not a separate write.

   ONE voice is set up via `sharc_harness.setup_voice()`, with a `--freq`
   Hz sine (default 1000 Hz, at `sharc_harness.SOURCE_SAMPLE_RATE`) written
   to its sample buffer -- **not** from the captured frame, because the
   SHARC-side code path that would turn a received DSPI2 frame into an
   active voice record (a written record word +0 / ACTIVE) is still not
   found even with the transfer delivered correctly this time (see this
   lane's own report). This tool's own `voice_activated_by_firmware` is
   therefore still always `False` for voice 0 (the one it sets up by
   hand) -- it names the missing link instead of quietly working around it
   and calling that "firmware-driven". `scan_voice_active` reports whether
   the firmware itself ever marked any *other* voice record ACTIVE
   (`+0x1b8`) while this replay ran, independent of the one this tool sets
   up by hand.

4. **Collects ring A** (DAC output, `0x261cc8 + (flag<<8)`,
   docs/findings/06's "Rings": already Q31, L/R-interleaved, at the final
   output rate -- unlike the single-voice work buffer, this is NOT run
   through `sharc_harness.decimate()`) after each call, and writes an
   L+R-averaged mono WAV from it. **The SHARC's TX reply** -- an actual
   outgoing DSPI2/SPI packet -- is not collected, because no code path that
   builds one is known in either image yet (docs/findings/04: "What happens
   to 2748 after the call is not known... No write to an SPI or DMA
   register has been found yet"); this tool does not invent one.

Stops are reported exactly as `tools/sharc_survey.py`'s `CollectStop`s give
them (category, pc, form, unknowns), via `FRAME_PATCH_TABLE` the same way
`sharc_harness.render_frames()` applies it. This tool never adds a new
patch-table hypothesis of its own -- one belongs in `FRAME_PATCH_TABLE`
(tools/sharc_harness.py, this lane's own file), not here.

    control ever reach any of TRACE_PCS during this one frame call", with a
    real pc-hit breakpoint (`Runner.breakpoints`, checked natively inside
    `sharc_survey.run_collect_all()`'s own loop before an instruction
    decodes) rather than inferring reachability from a memory watch on some
    address a function is *believed* to write (lane E2, 2026-09-25/26 --
    see docs/findings/06's "Lane E2" section for why this matters: a
    write-target watch at a candidate offset can read as empty either
    because the function never ran, or because it ran but the watched
    address was wrong -- a pc-hit breakpoint at the function's own entry
    (or any other pc of interest) tells the two apart).

    `Runner.fresh_call()` already carries `breakpoints` forward (`new_runner
    .breakpoints = self.breakpoints`, tools/sharc_run.py), so TRACE_PCS is
    installed on the fresh_call runner this makes internally -- a caller
    does not need to pre-set `runner.breakpoints` itself. A breakpoint hit
    is not fatal to the frame call: this function clears `breakpoints`
    (saving the set first), executes exactly the one instruction at that pc
    (`Runner.step()`, tools/sharc_run.py's own single-instruction API,
    unaffected by whatever `sharc_survey.run_collect_all()`'s own inlined
    stepping loop does elsewhere), restores `breakpoints`, and resumes
    `run_collect_all()` -- so a frame with several hits (e.g. a function
    called once per voice/track, in a `DO 32` loop) still runs to its real
    terminal (`frame-returned`, a genuine fork, an MMR trap, ...), with
    every intermediate hit recorded rather than only the first.

    Returns `(runner, result, hits)`: `runner` is the fresh_call Runner,
    positioned at the true terminal stop (not at a hit -- hits are always
    stepped past); `result` is that terminal leg's own `CollectAllResult`
    (earlier legs' own stops, if any, are not merged in -- only the hits
    list accumulates across legs); `hits` is
    `[{"pc": "0x...", "instructions": N}, ...]`, oldest first, `N` being
    `runner.instructions` (this frame's own running count, comparable
    across hits and to `result.instructions`) at the moment of that hit,
    before the pc's own instruction executed. Stops at `max_hits` hits
    (a runaway loop should not build an unbounded list) or `max_steps`
    total instructions, whichever comes first -- either way, `result`
    still reports whatever terminal `run_collect_all()` last reached.

    `sample_fn`, if given, is called as `sample_fn(new_runner, terminal.pc)`
    right when a hit is recorded -- *before* that pc's own instruction has
    executed, so it sees exactly the register/memory state the about-to-run
    instruction (often a conditional jump) will read. Its return value
    (any JSON-able dict) is merged under the hit's own `"sample"` key.
    Never called when `sample_fn` is None (the default), which keeps every
    existing caller's hit-dict shape (and tests/test_sharc_replay.py's own
    assertions on it) unchanged -- this is a pure opt-in addition, not a
    behaviour change (lane H3, 2026-09-26, tools/sharc_armpath.py's own
    caller: reading raw register state at a guard jump this way, rather
    than re-deriving it from the disassembly's own displacement units,
    which sharc_core's `modify()` resolves once and correctly already).

# Lane J1 replayed `out/captures/dt2-1.16-running-trig.dt2cap` from a
# `--start-frame 300` shortcut (skipping frames 0-299 without executing
# them) and found voice 4's own FIELD_SAMPLE_PTR (word+0,
# `sharc_harness.FIELD_SAMPLE_PTR`) already null (`0x0`) from the very
# first frame that shortcut fed -- on BOTH the TRIG and the idle capture --
# even though voice 4's record reads a real SDRAM address (`0x8045a6c8`)
# right after `run_init()`. J1's own report flagged this as possibly a
# cold-start artifact of the shortcut itself, not a genuine frame-300
# event, and left it open. This section answers that with a real,
# continuous replay from frame 0 (no `start_frame` shortcut) -- see
# `replay_armed_voice()`.

# --- Lane N2 (2026-09-26): a real sample through the firmware's own arm,
# not silence -----------------------------------------------------------
#
# Lane K1 (above) proved the firmware genuinely arms voice 4 from a real
# TRIG (`arm_frame=304`), but that voice's own word+0 (the raw-PCM pointer)
# was already null by then -- zeroed at frame 1 by `FUN_1c4e70`'s own
# generic per-voice "clear" utility (`0x1c4e86` for word+0, `0x1c4e8a` for
# ACTIVE -- see K1's own disassembly), which runs unconditionally, every
# frame, for every "in-service" voice slot, before that same frame's own
# arm/render dispatch. This section drives a REAL sample through that same
# real arm event instead of leaving word+0 null, by reacting to three pcs
# (two already found by K1, one this lane found by execution when the
# first two alone measured a ~15x-too-quiet render -- see
# `_make_voice_rearm_hook()`'s own docstring for that trace):
#
# 1. `VOICE_ARM_PC` (`0x1c4ebb`, inside `FUN_1c4eaf`): the firmware's own
#    real arm write (`ACTIVE=1`). The instant this fires for the voice
#    this replay is watching, the hook only flags `armed=True` -- it does
#    NOT poke the record here (see point 3: a real setup_voice() poke
#    placed here gets clobbered before the render ever sees it).
#
# 2. `REARM_CLEAR_PC` (`0x1c4e86`, word+0) and `REARM_ACTIVE_CLEAR_PC`
#    (`0x1c4e8a`, ACTIVE): K1's own "generic per-frame default-clear"
#    writes (`FUN_1c4e70`'s own two stores, called for this voice slot at
#    the *start* of every frame's dispatch, arm or not). Once armed, the
#    hook re-pokes whichever of these two fields the clear just zeroed,
#    for as many frames as the sample needs to play once through
#    (`_frames_for_sample()`) -- and then deliberately stops, letting the
#    NEXT such clear silence the voice again, so the demo ends in the same
#    natural silence a real one-shot playback would. A DIFFERENT pc
#    clearing ACTIVE while armed (docs/findings/06's own past-limit
#    `0x1c5008` or wrap `0x1c50fe`) is left alone and ends the keep-alive
#    window early -- a real end-of-sample event, not this hook's target.
#
# 3. `profile(image).voice_render`'s own entry (checked against the
#    incoming `R4` -- the record base -- since this entry point is shared
#    by all 32 voices' own per-frame dispatch): `sharc_harness.setup_voice()`
#    (reused as-is, per this project's own convention of not re-deriving a
#    voice-record poke sequence twice) is (re-)applied here, EVERY frame
#    the keep-alive window is open, because something in this capture's own
#    per-voice dispatch -- almost certainly one of docs/findings/06's own
#    "four position/step setters", fed by this capture's own stale/null
#    per-track parameter tables -- overwrites STEP/END back to a stale,
#    near-zero value every single frame, not just once after the arm (this
#    lane's own finding, by execution: see `_make_voice_rearm_hook()`'s
#    docstring for the before/after trace). FIELD_PHASE is the one field
#    `setup_voice()` sets that this hook does NOT let it clobber past the
#    first application -- saved and restored around every later call, so
#    the render's own natural advancement through the sample survives.
#
# This all happens inside `sharc_harness.call_frame_with_track_injection()`'s
# own per-instruction step loop (its new `post_step_hook` parameter, this
# lane's own addition there) -- a poke applied only between
# `call_frame_with_track_injection()` calls (i.e. once per frame) would be
# too late: the very same clears/clobbers run again, for the very same
# voice, before that later frame's own render check, so only a hook that
# can react between two instructions of the SAME frame can keep the voice
# alive, and correctly paced, across more than the one frame K1 already
# found.
#
# The one thing this lane's own step-1 check established: the built-in
# click/default sample at `0x8045a6c8` (every voice's own post-init word+0,
# per K1's report) is real audio, not silence -- a single-cycle,
# near-full-scale waveform, 368 samples long (matching `FIELD_SAMPLE_LENGTH`'s
# own init value, `0x170`) -- so no separate synthetic source or SDRAM

    """A `sharc_harness.call_frame_with_track_injection(post_step_hook=...)`
    callback (see that function's own docstring) that plays SAMPLE_BASE
    (SAMPLE_LEN raw samples, at PITCH_STEP) through VOICE the instant the
    firmware itself arms it (`VOICE_ARM_PC`), and keeps it alive against
    `FUN_1c4e70`'s own generic per-frame clear (`REARM_CLEAR_PC`/
    `REARM_ACTIVE_CLEAR_PC`) for FRAMES_NEEDED frames -- see this section's
    own module note for why this needs to run inside the per-instruction
    step loop, not between frames.

    SHARED is a caller-owned `{"armed": bool, "remaining": int, "setup_done":
    bool}` (mutable across every frame's own hook instance -- watch_log
    itself resets every frame, per `Runner.fresh_call()`'s own docstring,
    but this dict does not); EVENTS collects one dict per poke this hook
    applies (or declines to apply), for the caller's own report; FRAME_CELL
    is a one-element list the caller mutates (`frame_cell[0] = idx`) before
    each frame's own `call_frame_with_track_injection()` call, so events are
    logged against the right frame number without this function needing its
    own frame counter.

    **Why the real `setup_voice()` poke happens at `voice_render` entry,
    every frame, not once at the arm event (lane N2, found by execution,
    not predicted).** The first version of this hook applied
    `setup_voice()` once, immediately on `VOICE_ARM_PC` (the same frame's
    own `ACTIVE=1` write) -- and measured a rendered amplitude about 15x
    smaller than `sharc_harness.reference_render()`'s own independent math
    predicts for this sample. Reading FIELD_STEP/FIELD_END back after that
    frame's own call showed neither held what `setup_voice()` had just
    written (`step` read back as `~0.0124`, not `1.0`; `end` as `-1.0`,
    not `sample_len`) -- something *else* writes those same fields, later
    in the SAME frame's own per-voice dispatch, after the arm but before
    the render: almost certainly one of docs/findings/06's own "four
    position/step setters" (`0x1c4afe`/`0x1c4bf9`/`0x1c4d88`/`0x1c4a31`),
    from this capture's own stale/null per-track parameter tables (the
    same "no real kit/mixer configuration is loaded" gap this project's
    own frame-render lanes already found elsewhere).

    Moving the poke to `voice_render`'s own entry (`profile(image).
    voice_render`, checked against the incoming `R4` -- the record base,
    per `sharc_harness.py`'s own "Corrected voice call convention" --
    since this entry point is shared by all 32 voices' own dispatch, once
    per frame each) fixed frame 304 alone (the arm frame): its own
    injected output then matched `reference_render()` almost exactly. But
    reading STEP/END back after frame 305 showed them clobbered again, to
    the SAME stale values, and frame 305's own injected output was
    correspondingly near-flat (PHASE barely advancing) -- so whatever
    writes these fields runs EVERY frame this voice is active, not just
    once after the arm (an ordinary per-frame parameter refresh from the
    same stale tables, not a one-shot "position/step setter" reacting to
    SEED_PENDING as this lane first assumed). This hook therefore reapplies
    `setup_voice()`'s own sample-pointer/length/start/end/loop_start/step/
    loop/reverse fields at `voice_render` entry EVERY frame the keep-alive
    window is open (`shared["armed"]`) -- but saves and restores
    FIELD_PHASE around each call after the first: `setup_voice()` always
    resets PHASE to `start`, and only the very first application should do
    that (seeding position 0) -- every later frame must instead preserve
    PHASE at wherever that SAME frame's own upstream clobber-then-fix
    sequence left it, letting the render actually advance through the
    sample instead of restarting it every frame."""

       32 voice records (`_voice_word0_watchpoints()`) plus one on VOICE's
       own FIELD_ACTIVE (`_voice_active_watchpoint()`) -- every hit is
       collected into `word0_writes`/`active_writes` (frame, pc, old/new),
       oldest first, across the WHOLE replay, not just a bracketed window.

    2. VOICE's own decimated render output injected straight into the
       master mix (`inject_track=False, write_master_mix=True` --
       `sharc_harness.inject_master_mix()`, the SAME "existing harness
       path" `sharc_harness.render_frames_to_ring_a()`'s `--ring-a` CLI
       already uses, just pointed at VOICE's record instead of a
       hand-driven one) on every frame -- harmless before VOICE is ever
       armed (its own work buffer reads as silence), and the one thing
       that lets a firmware-armed voice's real output reach ring A without
       a second, separate render pass, since master mix
       (`sharc_dac.MASTER_MIX_BASE`) is a disjoint memory range from every
       voice record and every byte this lane's own watchpoints track --
       this injection cannot perturb the arming logic itself. **This
       injection is the one hand step in this replay** (see `main()`'s own
       `--armed-voice-wav` help text).

    VOICE's own FIELD_ACTIVE is re-read (not just watched) after every
    frame's call, into `active_by_frame` (`bool`, oldest first): the
    firmware's own `+0x1b8` state right after that frame finished, the
    same convention lane J1 used ("ACTIVE is 1 at frame 304"). `arm_frame`
    is the first frame index where this is True (`None` if VOICE is never
    armed in this replay); `active_frames` counts how many CONSECUTIVE
    frames from `arm_frame` stay True; `deactivate_pc` is the first
    `active_writes` entry at or after `arm_frame` whose new value is 0 (the
    exact pc of the `+0x1b8` clear -- docs/findings/06's `0x1c5008`
    past-limit or `0x1c50fe` wrap), or `None` if the run ends first.
    `sample_pointer_at_arm` is VOICE's own word+0 value from JUST BEFORE
    `arm_frame`'s own frame was delivered (`sample_ptr_before_frame[arm_frame]`
    -- matching lane J1's own "just before this lane's first fed frame"
    phrasing) -- not the value after that frame's own render, which may
    already have changed it.

    Ring A (`sharc_harness.read_ring_a()`, deinterleaved L/R -- NOT this
    module's own `_read_ring_a()`/`_mono()`, whose plain `0.5*(L+R)`
    downmix cancels to silence for a coherent signal identically written
    to both channels, per `sharc_harness.py`'s own "ring A's own L channel
    is deliberately negated" module note) is read every frame and kept
    per-frame; `render_left`/`render_right` are the concatenation of frames
    `[arm_frame, arm_frame + active_frames + EXTRA_FRAMES)` -- the demo
    window the task brief asks for -- or `[]` if VOICE was never armed.

    `INJECT_REAL_SAMPLE` (lane N2, 2026-09-26, default False -- the
    original K1 behaviour is unchanged when this is left off): instead of
    only watching/logging, drive a real sample (`BUILTIN_SAMPLE_BASE`/
    `BUILTIN_SAMPLE_LEN`, this lane's own step-1 finding -- see this
    section's own module note) through VOICE the instant the firmware
    itself arms it, and keep it alive against `FUN_1c4e70`'s own generic
    per-frame clear for as long as the sample needs to play once through
    (`_frames_for_sample()`) -- see `_make_voice_rearm_hook()`'s own
    docstring for exactly what this pokes and when. Adds `pokes` (the
    static `POKE_DESCRIPTIONS` list, so a report always documents every
    poke it could have applied) and `rearm_events` (what actually fired,
    oldest first: `{"frame", "field", "pc", "value"}`) to the returned
    dict; `active_by_frame`/`arm_frame`/`active_frames`/`deactivate_pc`/
    `render_left`/`render_right` above need no code change to reflect the
    extended, real-audio window -- they already read VOICE's own state
    fresh after each frame, which this keep-alive is now sustaining for
    longer than the one silent frame K1 found.

    `FRAME_OVERRIDES` (lane O1, 2026-09-26, default None -- no bytes changed
    when left off): a list of `(track, offset, value)` triples, each applied
    by `apply_frame_overrides()` to every delivered frame's own TX bytes
    before `sharc_harness.write_dma_transfer()` -- see that function's own
    docstring for the exact byte offset and encoding, and this lane's own
    O1 report for what reached (and did not reach) FUN_1c4e70/FUN_1c7442
    when it used this to carry the built-in sample's pointer/length for
    track 2. This is independent of `INJECT_REAL_SAMPLE` above: it changes
    only the bytes delivered over the (real, DMA) transfer, never a voice
    record field directly, so combining the two is possible but conflates
    two different hand steps -- this lane's own report used one at a time.

    Returns a dict with `capture`, `frames_replayed`, `voice`,
    `word0_writes`, `active_writes`, `active_by_frame`, `arm_frame`,
    `active_frames`, `deactivate_pc`, `sample_pointer_at_arm`,
    `render_left`, `render_right`, `sample_rate_hz`
    (`sharc_dac`'s own ring-A rate, `int(sharc_harness.SOURCE_SAMPLE_RATE //
    2)` = 48000), `pokes`/`rearm_events` (only when `inject_real_sample`),
    and `error` (only present, and everything else absent, if `run_init()`
    itself failed)."""
