"""One queryable SQLite database per SHARC+ image: instructions, functions,
control-flow edges, literals, memory-access facts and a relocation-tolerant
function hash for cross-image matching.

    uv run python tools/sharcdb.py build BLOB [--out out/sharcdb/<name>.sqlite]
        [--name NAME] [--min-depth N] [--blocks 1,56,69,...] [--force]
    uv run python tools/sharcdb.py build BLOB1 BLOB2 ... [--out-dir out/sharcdb]
        [--jobs N] [--force]

This exists so a question like "who jumps into 0x1c71ec" or "what writes
0x262138" is a `sqlite3` query in milliseconds, built once, instead of a
fresh ~5s tools/sharcfn.py load-and-decode plus a throwaway script every
time. It reuses every decoder already in this repo -- tools/sharcldr.py
(loader blocks, LoadedMemory, sw<->byte mapping), tools/sharcinv.py (code
block classification, function boundaries, the merged-field helper),
tools/sharcflow.py (call/return site finding, pcrel_target), tools/sharcfn.py
(render_instruction for the mnemonic text, register/condition naming) and
tools/sharc_disasm.py/sharcimm.py (the linear disassembler and its sweep) --
and adds no new instruction decoding of its own.

A CALL-only caller graph misses JUMP edges: a `JUMP IF SV` at sw 0x1c7053
into FUN_1c71ec went unrecorded for weeks because nothing but a bare
tools/sharcflow.py call/return scan was ever run over that address. The
`edges` table below records calls, plain and conditional jumps (with the
not-taken path as a `fallthrough` edge), returns and indirect sites
uniformly, so "callers of X" is a `to_sw = X` query across every kind at
once, not a CALL-only search.

Code-block selection. tools/sharcinv.py's CODE_BLOCKS (1, 56, 69, 76, 78, 80,
88, 91, 93) is a hand-verified list for one specific image (DT2 1.16) --
docs/findings/06-sharc-engine-and-startup.md, "The SHARC code is not one
block". It is NOT a general "decodes densely" rule: several DATA blocks in
that same image alias-decode at 70-97% density (blk19, blk35, blk37, blk48),
as dense as some of the small code fragments, so a decode-density threshold
alone silently mislabels data as code. This file therefore keeps a small,
explicit KNOWN_CODE_BLOCKS table keyed by image sha256 rather than guessing:
DT2 1.15C's block layout was checked by inspection to be identical to 1.16's
(same block indices, same target addresses -- reuses sharcinv.CODE_BLOCKS
directly), and DN2 1.11/1.10E's code blocks were identified by target-address
correspondence to DT2's known regions (the shared 0x282403f0 loader, the
three small 0x2838xxxx blocks, startup at 0x28380548 and the main code
region), the same method docs/findings/11-sharc-cross-image-comparison.md
describes ("Selection uses the same loader-target code regions as the
existing DT2 inventory. The block indices differ where the loader stream's
preceding records differ."). DN2 1.11 also has an extra L2-window code
region past L2_BYTE_LIMIT (blk59, target 0x200779f8): sharcldr.LoadedMemory's
read_sw() fallback only covers L2_BYTE_BASE..L2_BYTE_LIMIT
(0x20000000..0x20020000), so that block's base_sw cannot be resolved with
the reused tooling and it is left out of KNOWN_CODE_BLOCKS -- reported as a
known gap, not silently treated as data. An image whose sha256 is not in
KNOWN_CODE_BLOCKS refuses to build without an explicit --blocks override,
rather than guessing.

#
# --- v12: Type3d/4d/14d confident decode; Type15a mem_access/dataref fix ----
#
# Two independent changes:
#
# 1. decode_table.json promotes Type3d, Type4d and Type14d from
#    unconfirmed_bits>0 ("uncertain" -- no second source beyond the single
#    PRM figure, docs/findings/05's "SHARC+-only encodings with no second
#    source" list) to unconfirmed_bits=0 ("confident"). Checked two ways,
#    independently, and recorded in docs/findings/05-sharc-isa-and-decoding.md:
#    (a) raw bytes of individual dt2-1.16 instances, re-extracted bit-by-bit
#    from the manual's own figure geometry (not through sharc_isa.py),
#    reproduce the database's decoded fields exactly, and the mnemonic
#    suffix the existing renderer already picks for every real Type14d
#    instance matches the PRM's own (l,x,d) -> BH/BHSE-family syntax table
#    with no exceptions; (b) the addresses/registers each instance touches
#    (repeated DM globals, a function-prologue register-save idiom, the
#    already-[V] 0x82a00000 SoC command block) are the dataflow a compiler
#    would actually emit, and every one of the 158 whole-image instances
#    (87 on the sharc_coverage.py render path from 0x1c2b24) decodes a
#    clean, aligned successor instruction. This removes the
#    "provisional 14d/4d/3d: decode confidence uncertain" sharc_coverage.py
#    gaps and lets sharc_trace.py/sharc_run.py execute these forms without
#    passing them as provisional.
#
# 2. extract_mem_access()'s DIRECT_MEM_FORMS branch treated Type15a's
#    32-bit "addr" field as an absolute address (mem_access.abs_address),
#    the same wrong assumption the v6 `ptr`-table comment already flagged
#    and _ptr_mem_form() already avoids: sharc-plus-prm pp.387-390 (Figure
#    15-3, "DM(24,I5)=TCOUNT") gives Type15a as DM(<data32>,Ia)/PM(<data32>,
#    Ic) -- an I-register-relative access, not absolute, unlike 14a/14d
#    (which this branch also handles and which genuinely are absolute).
#    429 dt2-1.16 rows carried a negative offset such as -0x87 (I7-relative)
#    as abs_address 0xffffff79 -- indistinguishable from a real address near
#    the top of the 32-bit space. Fixed: Type15a now gets its own branch in
#    extract_mem_access, setting base_reg/modifier (the same columns
#    INDEXED_MEM_FORMS/IMMOFF_MEM_FORMS use for their own register-relative
#    accesses) from the manual's g/i-bank and sign-extended offset, and
#    leaving abs_address NULL. The parallel dataref bug -- extract_literal's
#    caller tagged Type15a's literal role='abs_load'/'abs_store' the same
#    way as Type14a's -- is fixed the same way: Type15a's literal now falls
#    through to role='literal' (a modify delta, like 16a/18a/19a*), not an
#    address. INDEXED_MEM_FORMS/IMMOFF_MEM_FORMS (3a/3b/3d/6a_mem/4a/4b/4d/
#    15b) were checked and never set abs_address in the first place: only
#    Type15a's presence in the DIRECT_MEM_FORMS grouping caused this.
#
# --- v11: Type14d/3b/3d/3d(ptr) mem_access/ptr width -------------------------
#
# The same class of bug v10 fixed for Type4b/4d: extract_mem_access()'s
# DIRECT_MEM_FORMS branch still used the generic "long if l else word"
# fallback for Type14d (wrong -- its l/x bits pick byte/short(-sign-
# extended), see _type14d_width()); its INDEXED_MEM_FORMS branch always
# recorded width=None for Type3b/3d instead of decoding their l/x/w (3b)
# or w/ex/l/x (3d) bits (see _type3d_width()); and _ptr_mem_form()'s own
# IMMOFF_MEM_FORMS branch had the same "long if l else word" mislabeling
# of Type4b/4d bug v10 fixed in extract_mem_access, now fixed by reusing
# _immoff_width() there too (width is descriptive only in `ptr` rows --
# address arithmetic is untouched).
#
# --- v10: MULT regdef/reguse naming, Type4b/4d mem_access width ------------
#
# _compute_regdef_reguse()'s MULT branch used classify_compute()'s is_float,
# which is wrong for every MULT opcode except 0x30 ("FN = FX*FY"): bit 3 of
# the mulop opcode is MOD1's Integer/Fraction result-format bit, not a
# float/fixed switch (PRM Table 18-7). regdef/reguse rows for other MULT
# opcodes (e.g. 0x48, "UUF"-style fixed-point multiplies) previously named
# F-registers where the manual calls for R-registers.
#
# extract_mem_access() also mislabeled Type4b/4d's l/x/w-encoded byte (bw)
# and short-word (sw) accesses as "word"/"long" (that fallback is only
# correct for forms whose lone "l" bit really means long-word); see
# _immoff_width() and sharc_trace.ACCESS_WIDTHS.
#
# --- v7: interrupt-vector roots ---------------------------------------------
#
# CMMR_SYSCTL.IIVT is set at boot (confirmed by the byte-exact slot targets
# below), so the IVT lives in L1 block 0's 48-bit (PM) space at the fixed
# short-word address IVT_SW -- sc58x-2158x-prm pp.226-231 ("L1 Memory
# Interface": "Block 0 has 256 addresses reserved for internal interrupt
# vector table"; the exact numeric address isn't in either public manual,
# "see the memory-map in the product specific data sheet") and
# sharc-plus-prm Table 4-47 (IIVT=1 -> L1) / Table 4-46 (the 32 interrupt
# names IVT_VECTOR_NAMES below reuses verbatim). _detect_interrupt_vector_roots()
# reads the 32x24-byte slot table there and adds a `roots` row per slot whose
# 4 instructions aren't the all-empty pattern, for every image (DT2 and DN2
# alike -- the location and slot layout were checked byte-for-byte identical
# across all four .sqlite images this repo builds). Two further ISR dispatch
# tables (IVT_DISPATCH_TABLES, an ASTATX-indexed and a SEC-id-indexed one)
# were checked the same way and found to sit entirely inside a boot-stream
# FILL block on DT2 1.16/1.15C (argument=0, i.e. the ROM ships them zeroed) --
# _detect_dispatch_table_roots() detects that case and adds no root rather
# than reporting an all-zero table as "no code pointers" by coincidence.
#
# --- v6: `ptr` -- constant-pointer propagation ------------------------------
#
# mem_access.abs_address (and dataref's resolved_offset) only ever resolved a
# direct absolute form or a same-block literal-then-immediate-offset pair;
# every other computed address -- a literal loaded into an I register three
# blocks earlier, a post-modify walk by a hardware-reset M constant, a
# spilled/reloaded call argument, a DM(I6+k) frame slot -- stayed invisible
# to "who writes address X". analyze_image() now also runs a small,
# deterministic forward constant-propagation per function (see
# _build_ptr_rows()'s own module note, just above it) and records every
# memory access it can pin to a known base register value or a fully known
# address in the new `ptr(image, sw, base_reg, base_value, address,
# direction, width)` table; tools/sharc.py's Image.writers()/readers() query
# it. analyze()-only (no re-decode) is enough to backfill this on an
# existing database -- see analyze_image()'s own CREATE TABLE IF NOT EXISTS.
#
# --- v5: reach now seeds from every root, not just function entries --------
#
# _detect_reach() used to drop a root whose address wasn't inside any
# function's [entry_sw, end_sw) span. The only root kind that can happen to
# (loader_entry -- see _detect_roots) was therefore silently missing from
# `reach` on every image: DT2 1.16 and DN2 1.11 both put their loader entry
# inside a `data` block immediately followed by `fill` padding, with no
# bblock/succ path bridging that padding into the first application
# function (checked directly against both images' bblocks/succ rows). See
# _detect_reach()'s own docstring for the fallback this version adds.
#
# --- ColdFire images (import_ghidra) -----------------------------------------
#
# build_ghidra_database() fills this SAME schema from a tools/ghidradump.py
# dump directory (manifest.json/xrefs.sqlite/disasm/decomp) instead of
# decoding a SHARC+ blob, so every image -- SHARC or ColdFire -- is one
# `sharcdb.load()`/`sharc.py` API. meta.cpu is 'sharc' or 'coldfire';
# sharc.Image.trace() checks it and raises for a ColdFire image (no SHARC
# symbolic tracer for m68k). Column mapping, one column at a time:
#   - insn.sw / functions.entry_sw,end_sw / edges.from_sw,to_sw / dataref.sw:
#     the ColdFire BYTE address (there is no "short word" unit on this CPU;
#     the column is reused as-is rather than adding a parallel `addr` column
#     everywhere it's already keyed on `sw`).
#   - insn.raw: hex bytes exactly as tools/ghidradump.py's disasm_line() wrote
#     them (concatenated 16-bit words, no spaces); insn.mnemonic: its
#     rendered text (Ghidra's CodeUnitFormat string, not ours); insn.block,
#     .form, .fields, .cond, .confidence: NULL (no per-instruction decode of
#     our own to fill them). insn.aligned is always 1 (Ghidra has already
#     disassembled every byte; there is no sweep/depth ambiguity to record).
#   - functions.block/.label/.entry_kind: NULL (no loader block, no SHARC
#     label pass); functions.has_static_caller/.is_leaf: from the `edges`
#     this same import wrote (any incoming/outgoing call edge), same
#     definition as the SHARC build.
#   - edges: one row per tools/ghidradump.py `calls` row (already function-
#     level: a plain intra-function jump is dropped by that tool's own
#     collect(), never a reference at all). kind is the Ghidra reference type
#     with its UNCONDITIONAL_/COMPUTED_ prefix stripped down to this schema's
#     call/jump/cond_jump vocabulary (COMPUTED_* rounds down to the same kind
#     as its unconditional counterpart -- Ghidra had already resolved the
#     target, so there is no "unknown target" left the way SHARC's own
#     'indirect' kind means); the ORIGINAL Ghidra kind string (e.g.
#     "COMPUTED_CALL") is kept in `note` so that distinction isn't lost.
#     `fallthrough`/`return`/`indirect` never appear: a Ghidra dump has no
#     basic-block CFG to derive them from (see `bblocks`/`succ` below).
#   - dataref: one row per tools/ghidradump.py `data_refs` row; value=to_addr,
#     sw=site, form='ghidra', role=the Ghidra kind lowercased
#     (read/write/read_write/data) -- not a SHARC form label (14a/17a/...),
#     since nothing here decoded the instruction that owns it.
#   - decomp(image, function_sw, c): decompiled C read verbatim from
#     tools/ghidradump.py's own decomp/*.c (empty for a SHARC image, which
#     has no decompiler in this pipeline: Ghidra-only table, PK (image,
#     function_sw)).
#   - blocks, literals, mem_access, regdef, reguse, func_hash, bblocks, succ,
#     idom, loops: left EMPTY for a ColdFire image -- known gaps, not
#     silently-wrong data:
#       * blocks: Ghidra's own memory blocks (ram/MCF5441X_* MMIO regions)
#         don't fit this table's loader-block shape (idx/target_address/
#         byte_count); query xrefs.sqlite's own `blocks` table instead.
#       * literals/mem_access/regdef/reguse: instruction-decode facts this
#         import never computes (no re-disassembly of the ColdFire bytes;
#         Ghidra's own P-code has the same information but importing it is
#         future work, not done here).
#       * func_hash: relocation-tolerant hashing needs a decoder's own field
#         layout (SHARC's mask_relocatable); no ColdFire equivalent here, so
#         no cross-image function matching for ColdFire images yet.
#       * bblocks/succ/idom/loops: NO per-instruction CFG survives a Ghidra
#         dump at all -- tools/ghidradump.py's collect() only records a
#         reference that is a CALL or a JUMP to a DIFFERENT function's entry
#         (see its build_rows()); an ordinary intra-function branch is never
#         turned into a reference, so this import cannot reconstruct basic
#         blocks, successors, dominators or loops. `functions`/`edges`
#         (function-level call graph) are still complete; analyze_image()'s
#         idom/loop pass simply sees no bblocks rows for this image and
#         produces no rows for it either (not an error).
#   - roots: the SHARC-only detectors (loader_entry, code_pointer_array,
#     rtos_task) are already gated on `mem`/`blocks`/the `literals` table,
#     which build_ghidra_database() never supplies, so they emit nothing for
#     a ColdFire image without a separate code path. dataref_code_pointer and
#     no_static_entry are already CPU-generic (pure SQL over
#     dataref/edges/functions) and fire the same way for both CPUs. The one
#     ColdFire-specific ADDITION is `vector_entry`: any function whose Ghidra
#     name matches `vector_<N>_handler` (an exception/interrupt vector table
#     entry Ghidra already named) -- a SHARC function is always named
#     FUN_%06x, so this pattern never matches there either, and needed no
#     cpu flag threaded through _detect_roots.
#   - reach/callgraph: fully reused (they only read edges/functions, both
#     CPU-generic tables).

# --- constant-pointer propagation (`ptr` table, DB_VERSION 6) --------------
#
# A simple, deterministic forward dataflow per function, over the same
# bblocks/succ this file already built, tracking known 32-bit constants for
# every register (I0-I15, R0-R15, M/L/B, ...) plus DM(I6+k) frame slots keyed
# by their raw offset (I6 -- docs/findings/06 -- is this ABI's frame
# pointer; its own runtime value is never tracked, only slot identity, so a
# spill/reload pair resolves regardless of what I6 actually holds at
# runtime). Rounds re-seed a function's R4/R8/R12 from its call sites'
# previous-round values when every caller agrees, approximating the RTOS-
# task/RPC-argument convention _detect_roots's rtos_task detector already
# relies on for a single call site; a handful of rounds is enough for a
# short call chain to converge without chasing a true fixed point.
#
# Modelled, mirroring tools/sharc_trace.py's own handling of each form (the
# chosen source of truth for scaling/addressing, since this pass is a static
# approximation of exactly what that tracer executes dynamically):
#   - 17a/17b literal loads (extract_literal already generalises the
#     destination to any ureg, R included).
#   - 19a/19a_scaled MODIFY: dest is Is XOR Idis (bank-adjusted by `g`);
#     19a_scaled's immediate is scaled x4/x2 for a normal-/short-word
#     modifier, exactly as the tracer's assume_nw32 branch does (this repo
#     always assumes 32-bit internal normal words -- tools/sharc.py's
#     trace()). 19a_bitrev's destination is always invalidated: bit-reversed
#     addressing is not a plain add.
#   - 5a/5b_move ureg-to-ureg copies.
#   - A conservative add/sub/inc/dec/pass/neg subset of the 23-bit parallel
#     compute field (COMPUTE_FORMS) and the 2c short-compute field -- every
#     other opcode (multiply, shift, logic, float, dual add/subtract, ...)
#     invalidates its destination rather than guessing.
#   - Every direct (14a/14d), indexed (3a/3b/3d/6a_mem) and immediate-offset
#     (4a/4b/4d/15b) memory form's own addressing math, INCLUDING Type15a's
#     I+immediate address: tools/sharcfn.py's DIRECT_MEM_FORMS groups 15a
#     with the pure-absolute 14a/14d, but PRM p.388 and tools/sharc_trace.py's
#     own "15a" handler both give it an I-register-relative address (its
#     DM(I6-4)/DM(0xfffffffc,I6) example is the exact frame-slot pairing
#     this pass exists to resolve) -- treating it as pure-absolute here would
#     silently mis-locate every Type15a access whose I register isn't zero.
#     I-register post-modify (u=1) commits the new value; pre-modify/no-
#     writeback (u=0) leaves the register untouched, exactly as the tracer's
#     own post_modify branch does. Bank selection (g=1 -> physical register
#     +8, DAG2/PM) is applied uniformly here -- unlike this file's EXISTING
#     extract_mem_access, whose INDEXED_MEM_FORMS branch never adds that +8
#     (a pre-existing, out-of-scope gap confirmed directly against
#     tools/sharcspec/decode_table.json's field widths and sharc_trace.py's
#     own bank math; left alone rather than risk-edited under this task).
#   - Type3c (the plain-R-register "DM(Ii,Mm) = Rd" encoding tools/sharcfn.py
#     also renders as the I7/M7 stack-push idiom, but dmi/dmm are ordinary
#     register fields -- FUN_1c15e3's workspace-copy loop uses it with
#     dmi=I4/dmm=M6): always DM, always mandatory post-modify (no g/u
#     fields at all), exactly like an INDEXED_MEM_FORMS u=1 access.
#
# NOT modelled -- the affected register/slot is always invalidated, never
# guessed: Type16a/16b (immediate-to-memory store), Type1a/1b dual DM+PM
# forms (tools/sharc_trace.py does not execute either), any ALU/MULT/SHIFT/
# MULTIFN opcode outside the small integer subset above, and any memory LOAD
# from a non-frame-slot address (the loaded value is runtime data, not a
# static fact this pass can know from decoding alone).
#
# Merge at a block join keeps a key only when every already-visited
# predecessor's out-state agrees on it. Blocks are visited in a per-function
# topological order that drops loop back edges, reusing analyze_image()'s
# own already-computed `idom` (an edge u->v is a back edge exactly when v
# dominates u -- the same test _detect_dominators_and_loops uses); a loop
# header's in-state is therefore its value on FIRST arrival only, never
# updated by a later iteration's own store/modify -- which is exactly what
# makes a loop that walks a pointer across iterations resolve to one
# loop-invariant base address rather than "unknown" (FUN_1c15e3's per-
# iteration store, tested below). A not-yet-visited or back-edge predecessor
# simply contributes nothing to a merge, the same safe "drop rather than
# guess" default this pass uses throughout. A block with NO confident
# predecessor at all -- the function's own entry, or one only an unresolved
# indirect jump reaches (a dispatch-table case; see _build_ptr_rows) --
# falls back to the entry baseline for registers and an empty frame, and is
# itself marked unconfident so that guess can never zero out a real,
# still-tracked value at a later genuine reconvergence (see
# _build_ptr_rows's own note on FUN_1c642a, where this mattered directly).
