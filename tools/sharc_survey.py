"""Reusable frame-render/routine survey driver.

Promoted from a scratch driver (a lane-L7 survey of FUN_1c2b24, the frame
render root) into a general tool: start from an already-booted state (a
tools/sharc_run.py snapshot, or a fresh tools/sharc_harness.run_init()),
jump to an arbitrary root with Runner.fresh_call(), apply an accumulated
table of register/memory hypotheses each time a given pc is about to
execute, run with diagnose_unknown=True, and print a rich diagnosis of
whatever it stops on.

    uv run python tools/sharc_survey.py dt2-1.16 --root 0x1c2b24 \\
        --snapshot /path/to/init_cache.snap

    uv run python tools/sharc_survey.py dt2-1.16 --root 0x1c2b24 --run-init

    uv run python tools/sharc_survey.py dt2-1.16 --root 0x1c2b24 \\
        --snapshot /path/to/init_cache.snap --patch-table hyps.py

Workflow: run once, read the printed diagnosis (unknown bits, the last
instruction that wrote each one, a bounded backward slice from the stop,
and the call stack with function names), add a hypothesis to a patch-table
file for whatever it found, and re-run -- the patch table is applied fresh
on every pc recurrence, so an already-diagnosed stop is skipped over on the
next run and only a genuinely new one halts it. A patch-table file's
hypotheses accumulate; this tool itself never resumes from where it halted
(no ad hoc, unrepeatable in-memory state) -- see run_with_patches()'s and
--patch-table's docstrings.

    import sharc_survey as sv
    stop = sv.survey(image="dt2-1.16", root=0x1c2b24, snapshot=path)

#
# survey()/run_with_patches() stop at the FIRST halt: useful once a patch
# table already resolves everything upstream of the one new stop being
# diagnosed, but turning a whole call's worth of unknown forks into a punch
# list this way is one run per fork, by hand. run_collect_all() instead
# keeps going through a fork by picking a branch itself -- the one named for
# that pc by a "branch" patch-table entry (see BranchPatchTable below), else
# a documented default (not-taken, i.e. the predicate assumed False) -- and
# records every stop (fork or otherwise) it passes on the way, so one run
# lists every blocker on a single path through the firmware instead of only
# the nearest one.
#
# Only a fork is something this can drive through on its own: every fork
# this tracer raises comes from exactly one idiom (SHARC_core's own
# "taken, not_taken = _copy(state), _copy(state)" / "executed, skipped ="
# pattern, repeated across sharc_core/forms_flow.py, forms_compute.py,
# forms_move.py, forms_dag.py and sequencer.py -- see _fork_diagnosis()'s
# docstring in tools/sharc_run.py for the full call-site count), which
# always returns the True-predicate outcome(s) first and the False-predicate
# outcome(s) second. Every call site observed produces exactly one State per
# side (`out` has length 2); a length other than 2 is a fork shape this
# tool has not seen and does not know how to split into "taken"/"not-taken",
# so it is recorded and treated as terminal rather than guessed at. An
# unmodeled MMR read and a return-target mismatch are also recorded, but
# never continued past: an MMR has no documented default value to assume,
# and a return mismatch means this run's own state is already wrong (see
# SurveyStop.category's docstring) -- stepping further from either would
# just manufacture more "blockers" downstream of bad state, not real ones.

# A PatchTable entry ("branch", <anything>, 0|1) resolves a fork at that pc
# to the not-taken (0) or taken (1) successor -- checked only once a fork
# has actually happened (out has more than one successor), unlike a "reg"/
# "mem" entry (applied unconditionally before the instruction executes, via
# apply_patches(), and often enough to avoid the fork in the first place).
# Both kinds may sit in the same PatchTable under the same pc.
