"""Parse and characterise the SHARC DSP blob (container section 7).

Section 7 is the SHARC DSP image. The ColdFire MAIN OS makes no audio; it
RPCs parameter changes to this DSP, so anything sound-related lives here.

The blob is a pure ADI boot-stream: with the FILL bit correctly identified
(see below), the entire file parses as a single block chain -- 104 blocks
for Digitakt II 1.15C and 96 for Digitone II 1.10E, consuming 100% of both
files. Per Table 40-29, a BFLAG_FIRST block's target_address is the start
address of the application it begins; the stream carries more than one
(Digitakt has BFLAG_FIRST blocks at 0x120230 and 0x1c1338), so the last
one is the final application's entry point (0x1c1338 for Digitakt, 0x1c12e2
for Digitone). BFLAG_FINAL's target_address carries no documented meaning
(Table 40-30).

The blob begins with an ADI boot-stream: a 16-byte, little-endian, four
32-bit-field (block_code, target_address, byte_count, argument) header per
block. A header is valid when its HDRSIGN names a target core and the
byte-wise XOR of all 16 header bytes is zero. block_code bit 8 is
BFLAG_FILL (0x100): when set, no
payload follows the header (the block is a zero/constant fill of
byte_count bytes) -- a FILL block has no payload in the stream; otherwise
exactly byte_count payload bytes follow. Table 40-33 confirms a FILL
block's `argument` field is the 32-bit fill value. Bit 12 is BFLAG_IGNORE,
not FILL. Other block_code bits are decoded per the standard ADI BFLAG set
(see BFLAGS below); any bit not in that set is reported as bitN rather than
inventing a meaning. The bit assignments below are confirmed against
Table 40-27 "Block Code Flags" of the ADSP-2156x hardware reference: bit 4
is BFLAG_SAVE, bit 9 is Reserved (there is no BFLAG_QUICKBOOT), and bits
24-31 (HDRSIGN) select the target core -- 0xAD/0xAC/0xAB for core 0/1/2.

Measured region split, as examples, not universal rules: Digitakt's tail
(everything after the 11,248-byte prologue) is roughly 56 KB of float-like
tables and 244 KB of "other"; Digitone's tail is roughly 72 KB float and
712 KB other -- Digitone's blob is 833,060 bytes total against Digitakt's
320,780. `kind` is a heuristic over bit patterns only: "float" means the
32-bit words decode as plausible little-endian IEEE-754 floats, which is
strong evidence of coefficient or wavetable data; "other" means only "not
obviously float or zero" -- it is NOT evidence of executable code.
Confirming code needs a SHARC disassembler, and stock Ghidra 12.1.3 ships
no SHARC, Blackfin or ADSP processor module (verified by listing its
Processors directory).

A previously circulated figure of "32 blocks, 178,796 of 320,780 bytes
loaded" does not reproduce with this parser: it finds 4 blocks and 11,184
payload bytes. That is a discrepancy to re-check, not a claim that either
figure is right.

Alignment analysis of the 10,312-byte loader payload (see `alignment()`)
finds repeated code motifs landing on even offsets exclusively but spread
roughly uniformly across mod 4, mod 6 and mod 8. That is 16-bit-granular
variable-length encoding, not fixed 48-bit words, and on SHARC+ that
encoding is VISA. This is an inference from alignment statistics, not a
decoded instruction, but it scopes any future Ghidra SLEIGH work to
SHARC+ VISA rather than classic ADSP-21xx fixed 48-bit. The encoding spec
is the publicly downloadable "SHARC+ Core Programming Reference"
(sc58x-2158x-prm.pdf) from analog.com, no registration required.

Usage:
    uv run python tools/sharcldr.py section_7_digitakt.bin --json out.json
    uv run python tools/sharcldr.py section_7_digitakt.bin --dump-blocks blocks/
    uv run python tools/sharcldr.py section_7_digitakt.bin --main out/sharc/dt2-1.16-main.bin

--main writes the final application's code as one file: the run of blocks
that starts at the last BFLAG_FIRST entry (as a byte address) and continues
while each block starts where the previous one ends, FILL blocks included.
