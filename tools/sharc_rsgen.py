"""Generate the firmware part of the native SHARC+ core: block code.

tools/sharc_transpile.py translates tools/sharc_core into Rust (the
``core_i``/``core_g`` modules). This generator writes what depends on the
image, under out/ (it embeds firmware):

- ``blocks_NN.rs``: region functions. Each basic block (``bblocks`` in the
  program database, or a PC the interpreter was seen entering, ``--entries``)
  becomes a body: its instructions run through the transpiled
  ``forms._execute`` partially evaluated in block mode (Translator.blk):
  the decoded fields, the PC, "no delayed transfer pending" and MODE1 are
  constants, and the registers live in the region's local register file
  (rt.rs Rf) from entry to exit, so LLVM keeps them in host registers.
  Registers the region reads must be known at entry (their known-bit
  masks become constants); a value that would become unknown, or a trap in
  the core, undoes the instruction (its written registers from copies, the
  rest from the state's undo log) and leaves it to the one-instruction
  interpreter. Bodies whose blocks follow each other often (``--transitions``)
  share a region and pass control directly, within ``--region-insns``
  instructions and ``--region-regs`` registers (a region's registers are
  live across it).
- ``spec_NN.rs``: the specialised core functions the bodies call.
- ``insns.rs``: the instruction statics the code still names.
- ``image.rs``: includes the above, the PC -> block table, the image's DO
  loop ends and hash; ``insns.bin`` holds every decoded instruction for the
  interpreter. ``--decode-range START:END`` adds short-word PCs absent from
  the program database, such as a loader entry and its following zero fill.
  It uses the ordinary loaded-memory decoder and adds no execution shortcuts.

Which blocks to generate, and for which MODE1 values, comes from where the
interpreter ran (``sharc-frames --coverage``: the executed set, not the whole
image). It also (re)writes the transpiled core next to them, so the interned
string numbers the block code uses are the core's.

# --- model-safe blocks -----------------------------------------------------
#
# The native core can run with opt-in models on (register banks, physical
# stacks, core timer, software IRQs, peripherals, instruction clock). Block
# code is the partial evaluation of the same core, and the core reads those
# models' switches at run time, so what block code does not do is what the
# *engine* does between instructions: complete a pending bank or PC-stack
# change, tick the core timer, take an interrupt, set EMUCLK, step a
# peripheral. A block is "model-safe" when none of those can matter inside
# it, given the engine's entry gate (native/sharc/src/lib.rs block_plan):
#
# - it writes none of MODE1 (a bank request), PCSTKP/PCSTK/MODE1STK/LADDR/
#   CURLCNTR (stack models), IRPTL/IMASK/IMASKP/MMASK (interrupt state),
#   TCOUNT/TPERIOD/MODE2 (timer) and neither reads nor writes EMUCLK, TCOUNT
#   (they are advanced by instruction count, not per instruction);
# - it holds no instruction that pushes or pops a stack explicitly (PUSH/POP),
#   aborts a loop, returns from or enters/leaves an interrupt (RTI, CI), and
#   no other system-register form (DO loops and the instruction at a loop's
#   last address are allowed: block code runs the core's own loop logic, with
#   loop_depth restored if the instruction traps);
# - what it has left is compute, moves, DAG modifies, memory accesses, jumps,
#   calls and RTS (also the (DB) return idiom, CJUMP and RFRAME: the stack
#   pushes and pops of a call or return are the core's own steps, and only a
#   PCSTKP write requests the PC-stack completion the engine does between
#   instructions) and the 21a/21c no-operations. Stores the peripheral model
#   acts on leave the block at run time (TRAP_BLOCK_MODEL).
