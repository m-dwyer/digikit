"""The memory input contract for a SHARC+ root function: which DM addresses
its call/jump reach set reads without writing itself, and who writes them
(a function outside the reach set, a loader-filled data block, a loader-
filled fill/zero block, or nobody this pass can find).

    uv run python tools/sharc_contract.py dt2-1.16 0x1c2b24

    img = sharc.load("dt2-1.16")
    contract = sharc_contract.build(img, 0x1c2b24)

This is a purely static contract, built on top of tools/sharcdb.py's `ptr`
table (constant-pointer propagation over aligned instructions only -- see
its own module note for what is and is not modelled). It is not proof an
address is genuinely live at runtime, and a resolved hit is only as good as
that propagation pass: an indexed I,M access whose M modifier is not a
tracked constant shows up separately as a 'base_only' hit (base register
value known, exact offset not), never silently folded into a hard range.

`mem_access.abs_address` is deliberately NOT used here: for a form 15a
access (`DM(I3 - 0x2a8)`, I-register-relative), that column holds the raw
negative OFFSET reinterpreted as if it were an absolute address (a large
0xffffxxxx value) -- a base-relative operand, not one. `ptr.address` is the
column built to give the real effective address (base + offset, from this
same constant-propagation pass), so every address in this contract comes
from there instead.

Reach is call+jump edges from the root's own function entry (every `edges`
row with a resolved `to_function`, of any kind -- call, jump, cond_jump, a
resolved indirect), not the narrower CALL-only `reach` table tools/sharcdb.py
already fills: that table is seeded from `roots` alone, so an arbitrary
function used as a root here (FUN_1c2b24 is not itself in `roots`) has no
rows there. See docs/findings/06's own "Reach from 0x1c2b24 ... 154
functions" figure -- this is the same walk.
