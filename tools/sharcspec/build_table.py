"""Merge PRM figures and classic PGR tables into one instruction decode table.

Rules (see README "Findings"):
  * bit positions and field names come from the PRM figure;
  * fixed-bit VALUES come from the classic PGR wherever it has a table for the form,
    because several PRM figures carry stale template digits;
  * PRM-only forms (SHARC+ additions) take PRM values and are marked unconfirmed;
  * where the PRM draws a selector field over bits the PGR splits into two tables
    (e.g. Type 8a "r"), the field wins;
  * errata overrides are applied explicitly and listed in the output.

Frames are 48 bits, MSB aligned: a 16-bit form occupies bits 47..32, a 32-bit form
bits 47..16. VISA availability comes from the PRM headings ("ISA", "VISA", "ISA/VISA").

# classic.json (the classic PGR) keeps each of these as two SEPARATE tables
# (e.g. "Type 8a" and "Type 8a #2") that differ in exactly one selector bit
# ("r" for Type8a, "rel" for Type9a/9b/10a) plus, in the r=1/rel=1 table, a
# different meaning for one field. The PRM draws only ONE figure per type
# and shows that selector as an ordinary field, which is why the old PAIRS
# merge (see the generic loop below) collapsed both classic tables into a
# single decode form and lost the addressing-mode distinction: the merged
# "addr"/pmi+pmm field cannot represent both an absolute address and a
# signed PC-relative displacement. See FINDINGS.md / task report for the
# firmware evidence (branch-target landing rate) that this split is right.
#
#   shared_target=<label>  : Type8a only -- the merged figure's own field at
#                             that label literally means ADDR when the
#                             selector is 0 and RELADDR when it's 1 (same
#                             bit range either way), so the rel form is just
#                             the abs form's fields with that label renamed.
#   shared_target=None      : Type9a/9b/10a -- the merged figure only ever
#                             shows the selector=0 (register-indirect: PMI

#                             interpretation. The selector=1 form instead
#                             gets classic's own 6-bit RELADDR field, which
#                             occupies exactly the same bits as PMI+PMM
