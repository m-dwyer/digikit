"""Concrete, single-path SHARC+ runner built on tools/sharc_trace.py.

tools/sharc_trace.py is a *symbolic* tracer: registers and memory it has not
been told about read back as ``Unknown``, an unresolved conditional forks
into several states, and every state deep-copies on each fork. That is right
for exploring what a routine's callers could pass; it is the wrong shape for
"run this one routine forward with real inputs to see what it actually
does" -- the question this module answers.

This module seeds every register with a real value (0, or the documented
SHARC+ reset value where sharc_trace already has one), keeps memory as the
loader image plus one flat write overlay (no per-path copies), and steps
:func:`tools.sharc_trace._execute` one instruction at a time. With fully
concrete inputs, every predicate sharc_trace would need to fork on should
already be resolvable, so this runner treats a fork -- or any state it
tracks as ``stopped`` -- as a hard stop: see :class:`Halt`.

    uv run python tools/sharc_run.py dt2-1.16 --start 0x1c4ecf --max-steps 20000

Library use goes through :class:`Runner` directly, without sharc.py's
sqlite/networkx machinery, given any already-loaded
:class:`tools.sharcldr.LoadedMemory`:

    import sharc_run
    runner = sharc_run.Runner(loaded_memory, start=0x1c4ecf)
    result = runner.run(max_steps=20000)
    print(result.halt.reason, result.instructions_per_second)

    branch form, also ASTATY's) AF/AN/AZ/AV bits (SHARC+ PRM p.4-53's
    LT/GE/LE/GT rule, or a SIMPLE_COND_BITS flag), or MODE1 (EQ/NE's PEYEN
    check, LT/GE/LE/GT's ALUSAT term, or -- for a SIMD branch form only --
    ``_predicate_simd_branch``'s own PEx/PEy combination, which reads
    MODE1 for *every* cond, not only EQ/NE and LT/GE/LE/GT). Rather than
    re-deriving from sequencer's private control flow -- which this runner
    does not own and would either have to import or monkeypatch across a
    module boundary -- this reads the same registers those functions would,
    using only the already re-exported sharc_trace helpers, and reports
    every one of them that is not concretely known, as "REG.BIT" (e.g.
    "ASTATX.BTF") rather than the old, coarser "REG flag" -- see
    _ASTAT_BIT_NAME, sourced from the same sharc_core.encoding bit numbers
    flags.py itself defines them with, never a second hand-copied table.
    "MODE1" alone (no bit) is reported as before: it is read/write as one
    whole register here, never through _astatx_known_bit's per-bit view.

    This is deliberately *eager*, not a re-implementation of that
    short-circuiting: for LT/GE/LE/GT it checks AF, AN, AZ, AV and MODE1
    unconditionally, and for a SIMD branch form it always checks MODE1 and
    both PEs' flags, so it can occasionally name a register the real branch
    would not actually have consulted (e.g. AV/MODE1 when AF alone already
    made the AV/ALUSAT term moot, or ASTATY/MODE1 when PEx's own condition
    alone already settled a SIMD branch) -- but it never misses the true
    cause, since every register the relevant predicate function could
    possibly read for that cond is checked. A COND field this cannot find,
    or a fork not reached through either predicate function at all, reports
    no names rather than guessing -- and, in that case, no "cond=" prefix

    did before -- so ``isinstance(state.concrete, LoadedMemory)`` checks
    elsewhere still see a real LoadedMemory once a read watchpoint wraps
    ``state.concrete``. This matters concretely: ``sharc_core.sequencer.
    decode_at()`` branches on exactly that isinstance check to decide
    whether it can call ``decode_confident_loaded()`` (the LoadedMemory
    path, no ``base_sw`` needed) or must fall back to flat-image decoding,
    which raises ``ValueError("base_sw is required for flat image
    decoding")`` when ``base_sw`` is None -- always true for a concrete
    Runner (see ``make_state``). A register-indirect/delayed call or jump
    (e.g. a Type16a form) reaches this: ``sequencer._advance()`` calls
    ``decode_at(state.concrete, None, target)`` to decide whether the
    target is loaded code, so a duck-typed (non-LoadedMemory) proxy there
    crashed every such branch once any read watchpoint was active, even
    one that never actually covered the target address.

    ``__init__`` deliberately skips ``LoadedMemory.__init__`` (which parses
    a boot stream into ``.data``/``.blocks``/``._segments``): this proxy
    is a read-through wrapper around an already-built LoadedMemory, not a
    second loader image, and building the real one already did that work.
    Only ``.read()`` is overridden; every other LoadedMemory method this
    class inherits unmodified (``.read_sw()``, used by
    ``decode_confident_loaded()``/``decode_loaded_at()`` for the loader-
    backed decode path above) is implemented in terms of ``self.read()``
    on the base class, so it transparently goes through this override too
    -- there is no second copy of that address arithmetic here. Nothing
    else calls a LoadedMemory method on ``state.concrete`` today (checked
    across sharc_core and this module); if that changes, a method this
    class does not override would raise AttributeError against the

      ``form_counts``, ``max_call_depth_reached``, ``breakpoints``.

    holds only ``Instruction`` records decoded from the image itself, so
