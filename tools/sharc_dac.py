"""The Digitakt II SHARC+ audio task's DAC-facing output format: ring A.

Static evidence (`out/sections/dt2-1.16/section_7_BLOB.bin`, sha
`0f514a12...`; see `docs/findings/06-sharc-engine-and-startup.md`'s "The
audio path from the task loop to the rings" and "Rings [V]", both already
marked verified by two agents):

* Command 3 ("render") of the audio task's block handler (`FUN_1c74cd`,
  dispatch table `DM(0x25f7b0)`) ends by calling `FUN_1c74a1` (sw
  `0x1c74a1`-`0x1c74cd`; call site sw `0x1c7734`, inside the command-3 body
  at sw `0x1c7671`-`0x1c7740`) right after `FUN_1c2b24` (call at sw
  `0x1c771e`) has filled the master-mix buffer at `DM(0x25f180)`.

* `FUN_1c74a1` itself hardcodes its own source pointer, `I3 = 0x25f180`
  (sw `0x1c74b0`) -- the master mix is NOT passed as an argument, only the
  two destination pointers (`R4`, `R8`) are. Its `DO ... UNTIL LCE` loop
  (sw `0x1c74b5`-`0x1c74c1`, trip count 32) reads `DM(I3, M6)` then
  `DM(I3 + 31)` each iteration. `I3` auto-increments by `M6` (=1 word)
  between the two reads; SHARC+'s byte address space scales a DAG modify's
  own offset/index by the access size
  (`out/refs/sharc-plus-prm/all.txt`, "Enhanced Modify Instruction for
  Address Scaling", p.6-9: a `word`-size (4-byte) modify of literal N
  advances the pointer by `N*4` bytes) -- so the second read's own
  `+31`-word (`+124`-byte) displacement, applied to `I3` AFTER its own
  post-increment, lands exactly on `0x25f180 + 0x80 + 4*k` for loop
  iteration k, i.e. on `DM(0x25f200)`'s own k'th word. `0x25f200 -
  0x25f180 == 0x80` bytes == 32 words, so the master mix is 32 PLANAR L
  floats (`DM(0x25f180)`) followed by 32 PLANAR R floats (`DM(0x25f200)`),
  plain IEEE float32, NOT interleaved -- matching
  `tools/sharc_harness.py`'s `read_master_mix()`, which already reads 64
  contiguous floats from `DM(0x25f180)` as one buffer.

* Each of the two samples read per iteration is converted with the ALU's
  documented scaled float-to-fixed idiom: `out/refs/sharc-plus-prm`
  (toc.md page 67, "Fixed-to-Float Conversion Instructions with Scaling"):
  "`Ry = 31; Rn = FIX Fx BY Ry; /* fixed-point 1.31 format */`".
  `FUN_1c74a1` sets `R2` (the `Ry` operand) `= 0x1f = 31` at sw `0x1c74b3`,
  matching exactly; the compute field decodes to ALU opcode `0xD9`
  (`fix_by`, PRM Table 18-5, `out/refs/sharc-plus-prm` p.425-427).
  1.31 fixed-point IS Q31: signed, full scale `+-1.0`,
  `value = raw_int32 / 2**31`.

* The two conversion results are stored through two DIFFERENT pointers
  that start only `R13 = 4` BYTES (one word) apart -- a plain register add
  (sw `0x1c74a6`/`0x1c74ac`, `R13` set to the literal `4` once at sw
  `0x1c7506`/reused at the call site `0x1c7737`; NOT a DAG modify, so NOT
  scaled by access size) -- but each pointer's own per-iteration
  post-modify (`+2`, a 'word'-size DAG modify, so `2*4 = 8` bytes = 2
  words per iteration per pointer) advances it past the OTHER pointer's
  next slot. Net effect: the two stores land at word offsets
  `{0, 2, 4, ...}` (from `I4`, the L result) and `{1, 3, 5, ...}` (from
  `I5 = I4+1 word`, the R result) of the SAME destination half -- a clean
  L,R,L,R,... Q31 interleave, one 32-bit word per channel per sample,
  32 stereo samples = 64 words = 256 bytes per half.

* The destination base (`I4`, `FUN_1c74a1`'s own `R4` argument) is
  `ring_a_base + (ring_flag_bit << 8)` (sw `0x1c7728`-`0x1c7734`; the shift
  amount `R11 = 8`, set at sw `0x1c7504`): `ring_flag = DM(0x25f780) & 1`
  selects which 256-byte half of ring A (base `DM(0x261cc8)`) the block
  handler is about to render into. `DM(0x261dc8) - DM(0x261cc8) == 0x100`
  bytes matches this exactly (`docs/findings/06`'s "Audio output buffers":
  "Ring A: head 0x2620c8, buffers 0x261cc8/0x261dc8, 256 B").

Dynamically confirmed (2026-09-25, lane C1 -- see
`docs/findings/06-sharc-engine-and-startup.md`'s dossier and the lane's own
report for the full transcript): an isolated `sharc_run.Runner.fresh_call`
at `FUN_1c74a1`'s own entry (sw `0x1c74a1`), given a FRESH master-mix
buffer poked with distinct, unambiguous per-index float values
(`L[k] = 0.1 + 0.01*k`, `R[k] = -0.2 - 0.01*k` for k in 0..31) and
`R4`/`R8` pointing at a scratch destination, reproduces EXACTLY this
format: 64 output words, word `2k == round(L[k] * 2**31)` and word
`2k+1 == round(R[k] * 2**31)`, both magnitude and sign correct to float32
rounding. This rules out a sign or stride bug in the conversion routine
itself (`tools/sharc_core`'s `fix_by`/opcode-0xD9 execution, and
`FUN_1c74a1`'s own addressing) as the cause of the "not a clean tone"
finding in a full continuous render -- see that report's own "stage where
the tone breaks" section, which places the break at or before the master
mix (`DM(0x25f180)`), one stage upstream of everything this module reads.

The functions below are this project's one reader for the ring-A/DAC
format (replacing `tools/sharc_harness.py`'s former hand-rolled interleave
logic in `read_ring_a()`) and a stereo WAV writer to go with it.
