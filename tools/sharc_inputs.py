"""Input sorter for a SHARC+ root: tools/sharc_contract.py answers "what does
ROOT's reach set read but never write itself"; this labels each such address
with where it plausibly comes from, so a lane chasing a stop does not have
to re-derive the same four questions by hand for every address in a
contract's read set.

Static labels, checked in this order (the first that applies wins):

    (a) init      -- FUN_1c15e3 (docs/findings/06) wrote it: present in a
                      real post-init Runner's own write overlay (see
                      run_init_state()). Reported with whether the written
                      value is zero or not.
    (b) coldfire   -- the address falls inside one of the four DMA output
                      ring's own two half-buffers (docs/findings/06, "Audio
                      output buffers" -- RING_BUFFERS below cites it
                      directly). Core writes rings A/C itself and only
                      reads B/D (fed from the ColdFire link -- the same
                      finding's "[C][V] Core code writes rings A and C and
                      only reads rings B and D"); a read landing on A/C
                      here is still labelled from this same table rather
                      than falling through to "no writer found".
    (c) sharc_root -- some OTHER SHARC+ function (outside ROOT's own reach
                      set) writes it: tools/sharc_contract.py's own
                      classify_external_writers(), named by function and
                      root classification (boot/init, audio task, RPC
                      task, ISR, ...).
    (d) no_writer  -- no writer this pass can find anywhere in the image.
                      Confirmed as cheaply as tools/refscan.py confirms a
                      ColdFire "no caller" claim on the raw image (CLAUDE.md's
                      Ghidra rule) -- but the SHARC-side equivalent of that
                      raw scan is already sitting in the program database:
                      tools/sharcdb.py's own exhaustive per-instruction
                      decode already built img.refs() (every literal
                      reference to a value, anywhere) and img.writers() /
                      img.readers() (resolved AND base-only/unresolved-index
                      hits), so this checks those rather than re-scanning
                      the blob's bytes by hand.

Usage:

    uv run python tools/sharc_inputs.py dt2-1.16 0x1c2b24
    uv run python tools/sharc_inputs.py dt2-1.16 0x1c74cd --json out.json

    # Cross-check against a real frame run's own read log (see
    # dynamic_view()'s docstring) instead of only the static labels:
