"""Lane H3 (2026-09-26): trace FUN_1c642a's per-voice arm/dispatch guard by
real execution -- which memory cells decide whether a voice iteration takes
the direct "arm" path (0x1c6540/0x1c6549 -> 0x1c657b -> `CALL FUN_1c4eaf` at
0x1c6582, which sets a voice record's own +0x1b8/+0x1ba fields) instead of
falling through into the per-slot-type jump table at 0x1c6553/0x8055c840
(docs/findings/06's Lane E2: on a real capture, all 32 voice iterations
land on 0x1c6553, never on either guard).

`sharc_core.flags._astatx_leftz`/`_astatx_bit_field` (bset/bclr/btgl) give
the exact flag semantics quoted above -- SV/SZ are not guessed from the
public PRM's mnemonic names alone.

`FUN_1c4eaf` itself (0x1c4eaf-0x1c4ec8): `I4 = R4` (the argument, a record
base), `I4 = modify(I4, 0x1ba)` -- **this one really is a raw-byte offset**
(out/sharcdb's own decode flags it `[raw-byte offset space=DM]`, unlike the
two guard loads above, which are the default word-scaled addressing) --
then `DM(I4, M5) u=0 = M14` at 0x1c4eb9 (record+0x1ba) and
`DM(I4, M7) u=0 = M14` at 0x1c4ebb (record+0x1ba+M7, the task's own
+0x1b8 -- M7's own value is read from the same trace this module records,
not assumed).

`FUN_1c2ac9`'s own two `CALL FUN_1c4eaf` sites (0x1c2b0a, 0x1c2b14) pass
fixed addresses (0x252730, 0x252908 -- confirmed by
`tools/sharc.py`'s static decode, not a voice-record base) as their own R4
argument, so a hit there arms something in the `render_frame` master-bus/
dynamics scratch tables (0x2524xx-0x2529xx, the same forest `FUN_1c2b24`'s
own compile-time GLOBALS list writes at every frame -- see
`out/ghidra/sharc-dt2-1.16/functions.jsonl`'s `FUN_001c2b24` entry), not a
voice: this module still traces both call sites (`FUN_1C2AC9`/
`CALL_252730`/`CALL_252908` below) so a report can say whether they run at
all, without claiming they arm a *voice*.

This module never edits `sharc_core`, `emu/`, or
`sharc_harness.FRAME_PATCH_TABLE` (other lanes' files): it only drives the
existing replay path (`tools/sharc_replay.write_dma_transfer`/
`drive_dma_completion`/`call_frame_collect_all_with_hits`, the last with
this lane's own opt-in `sample_fn` hook) with a wider breakpoint/sample set.

    sets `Pending(target, call=False, slots=2, ...)` for this exact form;
    a one-off probe of this pc, stepped instruction-by-instruction, showed

    `start_frame` (Lane J1, 2026-09-26) skips the first `start_frame`
    captured frames without replaying them through the SHARC at all --
    just `write_dma_transfer`/`drive_dma_completion` are not even called
    for them. This only saves time when the frames being skipped are known
    not to matter for the question at hand (e.g. bracketing a panel event
    deep into a long idle capture, as `tools/sharc_capture_run.py --kind
    note`'s default `trig_at` does): every companding-record/arm-guard
    finding this project has made (docs/findings/06, Lane E2/H1-H3) shows
    those cells depend only on `command_word_shift_src` (toggled by a
    transfer-complete DMA callback, unrelated to any frame's own content)
    and on a per-track bitfield-unpack function (`FUN_1c24e9`) that reads
    each frame fresh with no cross-frame accumulation of the fields this
    lane's own diff touched -- so replaying from an arbitrary frame index
    is equivalent to replaying from 0 for this specific question, at a
    fraction of the cost. `per_frame[i]["index"]` is still the frame's real
    index in CAPTURE_PATH (`start_frame + i`), not a re-based 0.
