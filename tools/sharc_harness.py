"""Render one Digitakt II SHARC+ voice offline with tools/sharc_run.py and
write it to a WAV, for correctness- and speed-checking the emulator against
a real firmware code path rather than a hand-written test vector.

    uv run python tools/sharc_harness.py dt2-1.16 --blocks 8 \
        --out /tmp/voice0.wav

Library use:

    import sharc_harness as h
    memory = h.load_image_memory("dt2-1.16")
    blocks = h.render_blocks(memory, voice=0, n_blocks=8)
    h.write_wav("/tmp/voice0.wav", h.flatten(blocks), sample_rate=48000)

Per docs/findings/06-sharc-engine-and-startup.md's "The voice record
contract" and "Voices" sections (two agents checked the contract table
against the 1.16 bytes): one voice occupies a 0x1d8-byte record at
``profile.voice_records + voice*0x1d8``. FUN_1c4ecf (``profile.voice_render``,
called the way FUN_1c642a's dispatch loop calls it: **R4 = the record
address itself**, not record+4 -- see "Corrected voice call convention"
below) is one voice's render, producing 64 interpolated floats at
record+4..+0x103 and, through its own call to the decimator at 0xb80000, a
2:1-decimated 32-sample block.

**Corrected voice call convention.** An earlier version of this harness
passed R4 = record+4, compensating with two empirical pokes (record+0x1bc
set to 1, record+4's first float set to 1.0) to reach the render body at
all. Both were papering over the same off-by-4: FUN_1c642a's real call
site (sw 0x1c6ad3-0x1c6b00) loads ``I4 = DM(I6-4)`` (frame_workspace,
``profile.frame_workspace``), computes ``R13 = DM(I6-4) + 4`` once before
the 32-voice loop and passes ``R4 = R13`` unmodified to FUN_1c4ecf/
FUN_1c5576 -- i.e. R4 = frame_workspace + 4 = ``profile.voice_records``,
the record base, confirmed directly against ``out/sharcdb``'s decode at
those sw addresses. Inside FUN_1c4ecf/FUN_1c4f81, I4 is set to R4 once
(sw 0x1c4f0f) and never rebased before the fields the contract table
documents at record+4.., record+0x1b8 etc are read through it -- so those
offsets are relative to the *record base*, matching the contract table
exactly once R4 is corrected. Both empirical pokes are gone.

**The record+0 open problem, resolved: it is the raw sample-data
pointer.** FUN_1c4ecf's own entry gate (sw 0x1c4f15: ``R4 = DM(I4, M5)``,
i.e. word 0 of the record) was previously undocumented ("[O]" in the
contract table's context) and empirically zero-filled unless non-zero,
alongside the ACTIVE byte at +0x1b8. Tracing FUN_1c4f81 (out/sharcdb
decode, sw 0x1c504a): **before I4 is rebased to +0x1b8** (sw 0x1c504c),
``I0 = DM(I4, M5)`` reads that same word-0 field, and the DO 64
interpolation loop (sw 0x1c5096-0x1c5101) reloads ``I4 = I0`` every
iteration (sw 0x1c50a4) before indexing the raw samples it multiplies
against the polyphase taps. So record+0 is a pointer: null means "no
sample assigned" (the gate FUN_1c4ecf checks), non-null is the address the
DO 64 loop actually reads PCM through. ``setup_voice()`` now writes
``sample_base`` there instead of setting a dead I0 register (I0 was always
overwritten before the loop used it -- this is why seeding the register
directly, as the previous version did, had no effect).

Symbols (function/data addresses) come from ``tools/sharc_symbols.py``'s
``resolve()`` against ``out/sharcdb``, not a hardcoded dict -- see
``profile()`` below. Only record layout (byte offsets within one voice
record, and the coefficient table's phase stride) are constants here, since
those are not independently-addressed symbols.

**--run-init now actually feeds the render (2026-09-25).** Previously,
``run_init()``'s Runner and its State were thrown away: ``render_blocks()``/
``check_correctness()`` always called ``new_runner()``, which builds a
*bare* State with an empty overlay, so FUN_1c15e3's writes (finding 06's
"Init writes") never reached a render even with ``--run-init`` on the CLI.
``new_runner(..., init=...)`` (an ``InitResult`` from ``run_init()``) now
starts from a copy of init's own post-return State instead (same
overlay/uregs/mmrs FUN_1c15e3 itself left -- see ``_clone_state`` for why a
copy, and why not ``sharc_core.state._copy()``). The bare-state path stays
the default (``init`` omitted) for comparison. ``setup_voice()`` was also
still poking every field it wrote by hand regardless of what a real trigger
sets; it now writes the documented net effect of a trigger (arm +
position/step setter -- see its own docstring) instead, and reports which
fields still have no documented trigger-path writer.

**CLI semantics corrected; THD+N re-measured on a coherent-sampling render
(lane L17, task 1/2, 2026-09-25).** See ``SOURCE_SAMPLE_RATE``'s own
docstring and ``main()``'s own comment for task 1's CLI fix (the source is
now a --freq Hz tone at the firmware's own 96 kHz sample-playback rate,
--sample-len auto-sizes from --blocks/--pitch-step via
``_default_sample_len()``, and the audible output is documented as
freq * pitch_step Hz).

Task 2 re-measured THD+N at pitch_step in {0.5, 1.0, 2.0} on a long,
*coherently-sampled* render (128 blocks = 4096 decimated output samples per
case, one block discarded up front for the startup transient, --freq chosen
per case so the *output* lands on an exact DFT bin -- 996.09375 Hz, bin 85
of 4096 at the 48 kHz decimated rate -- so a plain time-domain Parseval
split (total mean-square power minus the exact-bin fundamental's own power,
via direct sine/cosine correlation, no FFT/numpy needed) has zero spectral
leakage) instead of the previous short, truncated-prefix measurement
(-35.5 dBc at step 1.0 vs -65 dBc at 0.5 and -74 dBc at 2.0). Result: **all
three steps measure within about 0.5 dB of each other**, at -92.2 dBc
(0.5), -92.6 dBc (1.0) and -92.8 dBc (2.0) -- consistent with this
harness's own 16-bit (Q15) ``sample_format="int16"`` quantization floor at
the rendered amplitude (~0.405 out of a possible 1.0: 16-bit full-scale SNR
is ~98 dB, less ``20*log10(0.405)`` ~= 8 dB of headroom gives ~90 dB, which
is what was measured), not a real interpolation-accuracy difference at
unity step. **Step 1.0 is not "genuinely worse"; the previous -35.5 dBc
reading was a measurement artifact** -- almost certainly scalloping loss
from correlating a short, non-coherently-sampled window against an
off-bin frequency (this lane's own Parseval-split fundamental-power
estimate underestimates the true fundamental whenever the analysis window
does not hold an exact integer number of cycles, inflating the apparent
residual/noise term with no change to the actual signal), not a property
of the render itself.

This lane also checked the other half of the task 2 brief -- the
coefficient row at frac=0 (``read_coeff_table()``'s phase 0, the only row
pitch_step=1.0 with an integer ``start`` ever selects) -- against both the
static image and a post-``run_init()`` runtime read of the same address
(``profile(image).coeff_table`` = 0x25d940, confirmed identical between
the two: static six taps
``[-0.0452, 0.0478, 0.3902, 0.0629, -0.0543, 0.0033]``, so "0x25d940 has no
bytes in the static image" did not hold for this image/loader -- the
static ``LoadedMemory`` already resolves it). **Row 0 is not a pure
delay/unit impulse** (that would read as one tap at 1.0 and the rest 0); it
is an ordinary 6-tap lowpass kernel with real energy on every tap, the same
shape every other phase has -- so unity pitch_step still runs the full
polyphase filter (not an identity passthrough), but that filtering is
present at every pitch_step via its own coefficient row, not something
that singles out step 1.0 -- consistent with the near-identical THD+N
measured across all three steps above, not a competing explanation for a
difference that this lane's own re-measurement did not find.

#                that loop calls.

# facts' "R0" note describes it -- sw 0x1c4ef5 "R2 = pass(R12); DM(I6-8) =
# R2" copies it, and sw 0x1c4ef8 "R0 = add(R2, R2)" doubles it before

# both inside init's own function body (img.func(0x1c1643) resolves to
# FUN_1c15e3) -- not a guess: this lane's own post-init snapshot reads back
# exactly 32 there. The only other writer in the covered call graph is
# FUN_1cdbb2 (docs/findings/06: "a conditional per-track state
# accumulator", called from FUN_1c642a itself, sibling to the render
# calls) -- img.reach(profile(image).init, FUN_1cdbb2's entry) is False,
# so init alone never reaches it and this harness, which never calls
# FUN_1c642a either, has no path to it either: SESSION_TICK_ADDR is read
# fresh at every call_render() (never advanced by this harness), which is
# an open point ([O]), not a claim that a real multi-block run holds it
# fixed at 32.
#
# Without this, call_render() left R12 at whatever register value
# run_init()'s own ~1.24M instructions happened to leave it at (observed:
# 0, on this lane's post-init snapshot -- a leftover, not a 0 the firmware
# ever intended), so the callee's doubled R0 was 0 instead of 64. That

#
#   - "The voice record contract"/"Step [C][V]" (line ~3385): the four
#     step-setters (0x1c4afe, 0x1c4bf9, 0x1c4d88 and, by the same words,
#     0x1c4a31) compute ``step = ratio * rate / 96000 * 2**31`` -- ``rate``
#     is the voice record's own word 0x61 (FIELD_RATE, "u32", "not checked"
#     in the contract table but read by exactly these three setters), so
#     96000 is the reference this per-voice sample rate is normalized
#     against to land in the same Q31 units as ``pitch_step`` here. This is
#     the direct evidence: it is the same voice-render engine's own step
#     computation, not an unrelated filter.
#   - A classifier false-positive investigation (line ~2152) independently
#     found the float immediates pi, pi/8 and 96000.0 together in a
#     different function (blk93@0x1c5ed4, a `2*pi*f/fs` filter-coefficient
#     calculator elsewhere in the DSP chain) and concluded "The sample rate
#     is 96 kHz" from that alone -- corroborating, but not this constant's
#     primary evidence (that function is not part of the voice-render path
#     this harness drives).
#
# Combined with 0xb80000's own documented 2:1 decimation ("Voices [V]":
# "`0xb80000` (state +0x104) decimates 2:1 to 32 outputs"), the DO-64
# interpolation domain runs at 96 kHz and this harness's own decimated

# consistent, not a coincidence: write_wav()'s ``sample_rate`` default was
# already 48000 before this lane's task 1, it was just never derived from
# this constant. See main()'s own CLI semantics fix (task 1, 2026-09-25)
# for why this constant exists: the previous CLI generated the source PCM
# at ``pitch_step``-prescaled cycles/sample instead of at this fixed rate,
# so its ``--freq`` argument did not mean "the source is a --freq Hz tone"
# at all -- see main()'s own comment for the corrected math and the

# registers. Concretely tracing the real dispatch (this lane's own
# byte-level read of block_handler/FUN_1c75d8's cmd_handler_3 body, cross-
# checked by running it) found register plumbing that a purely static
# read of "the call site" (this lane's own task brief) could not resolve
# from FUN_1c75d8 alone: R12 at the CALL 0x1c2b24 site is `I3`, and I3 is
# never assigned anywhere in cmd_handler_3's own body or in the dispatch
# preamble (0x1c7501-0x1c7521) that runs before it -- it is `DM(I6-3)`,
# one of *two* by-reference outputs command_dispatch_fn (0x1c778a) writes
# into block_handler's own stack frame (`R4=&(I6-3)`, `R8=&(I6-2)` passed
# into that CALL at 0x1c74f8); the *other* output, `DM(I6-2)`, is exactly
# the "R1 = DM(I6-2) of the task frame" this lane's brief already named.
# Getting both right by hand (let alone the ring-buffer/`command_word`
# plumbing above them) is exactly the kind of bookkeeping a *real* call
# gets for free -- so `setup_frame()` only pokes the three DM cells that
# select which of the 4 audio-task commands runs (docs/findings/06's

#
# docs/findings/06's "Lane E2" traces the never-taken machine-type-compare
# branch (the one that would call FUN_1c60a2) back to `I5 = DM(0x254d78)`
# reading a null pointer, itself written (as one of four words,
# 0x254d78/80/88/90) by `render_frame` (FUN_1c2b24, sw 0x1c2c5e-0x1c2c67)
# from `M9 = DM(I6-18)` -- render_frame's own saved copy of `R1`, the SECOND
# by-reference output `command_dispatch_fn` (0x1c778a) writes into
# block_handler's stack frame before its CALL into render_frame (the FIRST
# being `command_word` itself, `DM(I6-3)`, per docs/findings/06's "Frame
# call path"). This lane's own task: find where `command_dispatch_fn` gets
# THIS pointer from, and whether it can be set up "the firmware's way".
#
# **Traced to a fixed, shift-selected table, not the SPI-slave control
# block at 0x261a10 (lane D2) and not a ring.** Reading
# `command_dispatch_fn`'s own raw bytes (sw 0x1c778a-0x1c77b0) end to end:
# it writes `DM(I6-3) = command_word + (DM(command_word_shift_src) << 12)`
# (the SAME formula docs/findings/06 already gives for the address
# block_handler reads ITS OWN pending command from -- `DM(I6-3)` literally
# IS the address of the command word, not a separate "ring C") and, right
# after, `DM(I6-2) = command_record_table + (DM(command_word_shift_src) <<
# 12)` -- a DIFFERENT, previously-unnamed base (`0x266220` on DT2 1.16, now
# `sharc_symbols.SYMBOLS`'s own `command_record_table`, resolved the same
# way `command_word` is: `LiteralAt('command_dispatch_fn', 0x1d,
# form='17a')`). With this harness's own `setup_frame()` (which always
# leaves `command_word_shift_src` at 0, per that function's own docstring),
# `command_record_table`'s shift is 0, so the record address is simply
# `command_record_table` itself -- confirmed by execution (a breakpoint at
# `0x1c2c51`, `I1 = M9`, reads `I1 == 0x266220` exactly).
#
# **The table is empty, and this lane found no writer of it anywhere
# reached from `run_init()` or a real capture-driven frame call.**
# `img.writers()` over `[0x266220, 0x266260)` returns only `base_only`
# (unresolved-offset) hits from `FUN_1c80f2`'s own unrelated master-mix
# ramp/crossfade loop (a `DO`-loop with a runtime-only trip count the tool
# can't bound, so it conservatively reports every address in the whole
# image as a possible target of that ONE loop -- confirmed by reading
# `FUN_1c80f2` itself, entry 0x1c80f2, called from `render_frame`'s own
# post-master-mix cleanup per docs/findings/06's "Master stage": not a real
# writer of this table). This corrects/pins down E2's own "no writer of a
# non-null value ... found" conclusion with the record's exact, now-named
# address, rather than the unresolved `M9`/`DM(I6-18)` chain E2 could not
# trace further. `command_word_shift_src` itself (the table's own selector)
# has exactly one writer, `FUN_1c77b4` (sw 0x1c77b4-0x1c77c8, `has_static_
# caller: 0` -- confirms docs/findings/06's own "no static caller" note),
# gated by a runtime condition (`JUMP IF NOT SZ` on `DM(I6,M7)`) this
# harness's own `setup_frame()` never drives, so even the SHIFT is not
# something a synthetic frame call exercises realistically.
#
# **Net for this lane's own task:** the record is very likely populated the
# same way the RX frame itself is (docs/findings/06: "The ColdFire frame is
# mapped into SHARC DM at 0x2558dc") -- written into DM directly by a DMA
# transfer this project's SHARC-side tracing cannot see (no SHARC store
# instruction needs to exist for a host-mapped region), OR by a SHARC
# "session start"/note-on preparation routine this project has never
# executed (not part of `FUN_1c15e3`, and not reached by any capture this
# lane or lane E2 replayed). Neither could be confirmed or ruled out within
# this lane's own scope; report, per this lane's own task brief, rather
# than fabricate a value for it (the same call E2 already made for
# `FUN_1c4eaf`'s own trigger site). `companding_record_address()` and

# --- Delivering the DSPI2 transfer at its real hardware address (lane G1,
# 2026-09-26) --------------------------------------------------------------
#
# Every earlier replay (tools/sharc_replay.py) wrote a captured frame's
# bytes straight into `0x2558dc` (the CONFIRMED-by-execution buffer
# render_frame's own per-track decode reads, docs/findings/06's "The
# ColdFire frame is mapped into SHARC DM at 0x2558dc") and forced
# `command_word` to that frame's own header value directly -- bypassing the
# real SPI-slave receive DMA and command_dispatch_fn entirely. This lane
# traces where those two cells actually come from on real hardware, so a
# replay can write the transfer at THAT address instead and let render_frame
# (FUN_1c2b24) do its own copy, the way a real DMA-then-firmware sequence
# would.
#
# **The receive DMA's ADDRSTART is `command_word` itself -- confirmed from
# both ends.** `FUN_1c7bd4` (the SPI-slave driver's own setup routine,
# docs/findings/04's Lane D2 -- it also calls `FUN_1c9fd5(R12=0x261a10)`,
# the control-block zero-fill lane D2 already traced) builds a 2-node
# descriptor-list ring at DM `0x2641b0`/`0x2641cc` (`sw` 0x1c7c60-0x1c7cc8):
# each node's own DSCPTR_NXT/ADDRSTART/CFG/XCNT/XMOD fields match the
# SC58x/2158x Hardware Reference's own Descriptor-List Mode layout
# (out/refs/adsp-2156x-hwr, Table 27-10, offsets +0x00/+0x04/+0x08/+0x0c/
# +0x10) closely enough to identify the fields (this lane did not chase the
# exact byte width of CFG/XCNT further); node 1's own ADDRSTART
# (`sw 0x1c7c6f`, `I5 = 0x265220`) and node 2's (`sw 0x1c7c89`,
# `I1 = 0x264220`) are EXACTLY `profile(image).command_word`'s own two
# ping-pong instances (`command_word + (shift<<12)`, shift 0/1) -- the SAME
# formula and the SAME addresses `command_dispatch_fn`/block_handler already
# use to find the pending command. A second, identically-shaped ring at
# `0x2641e8`/(the same base again) targets `command_record_table`'s own two
# instances (`0x266220`/`0x267220`, `sw` 0x1c7cb9-0x1c7cbc) -- provisioned
# in hardware exactly like the first, but a captured DSPI2 transfer (2,748
# bytes, `dspiframe.FRAME_BYTES`) is smaller than one 0x1000-byte ring, so
# it never reaches this second ring: consistent with lane F2's own finding
# that `command_record_table` is unwritten everywhere this project has run.
#
# From the CONSUMER side, independently: `FUN_1c2b24`'s own prologue
# (`sw 0x1c2b79`/`0x1c2b83`) saves its incoming `R12` argument (`command_
# word + (shift<<12)`, command_dispatch_fn's first by-reference output) into
# `M10`, and `sw 0x1c2c71`-`0x1c2c8b` -- gated by the flag below -- copies
# 512 long-word (2,048-byte, `0x800`) reads starting AT `I4 = M10` into
# `I5 = 0x2558dc`. So `0x2558dc` is a WORKING COPY render_frame makes of the
# real landing zone every frame, not the landing zone itself: TX byte 0 (the
# command header docs/findings/04 already reads at offset 0) is copied
# to 0x2558dc's own byte 0 unchanged, matching `sharc_replay.py`'s existing
# `COMMAND_HEADER_OFFSET` convention exactly, because `command_word` (word 0
# of the ring) and 0x2558dc's own byte 0 are now the SAME transferred byte,
# not two independently-poked cells.
#
# **`FUN_1c77b4` (docs/findings/04's Lane D2 driver callback) is exactly 9
# instructions and does exactly one thing:** `R2 = btgl(R8, bit=5)` (toggle
# bit 5 of its own event-code argument R8, also testing that bit's ORIGINAL
# value into SZ), `JUMP IF NOT SZ` skips the rest -- so ONLY when bit 5 of
# R8 is set does it `R1 = DM(command_word_shift_src); R2 = btgl(R1, R2);
# DM(command_word_shift_src) = R2` -- an XOR toggle of the ping-pong shift.
# No other memory is touched: this lane reads that as "toggle the ring
# select on a transfer-complete event" (bit 5's own ADI SSL event-code
# meaning was not decoded -- `DMA_SHIFT_CALLBACK_COMPLETE_EVENT` below is
# simply a value with bit 5 set, not a cited constant), with the underlying
# SPI DMA channel's own descriptor-list auto-advance (SC58x/2158x HWR
# "Descriptor-List Mode": the channel loads DMA_DSCPTR_NXT into DMA_DSCPTR_
# CUR on its own at the end of a work unit) doing the actual double-buffer
# re-arming in hardware, invisibly to SHARC code -- consistent with
# `has_static_caller: 0` (docs/findings/04: reached only through the ADI
# SSL library's own generic ISR dispatch, never called by name).
#
# **A second, still-open gate this lane found and had to work around:**
# the whole companding-fields-plus-2,048-byte-copy block above is itself
# gated (`sw 0x1c2c41`-`0x1c2c6e`: `R2 = DM(0x2567dc) (bw); R2 =
# leftz(R2, R0)`, PRM p.521 "SV = result == 32" i.e. SV set iff the byte
# was 0; `JUMP IF SV` skips the copy) by a byte this lane did NOT expect
# from any earlier finding. Empirically, `DM(0x2567dc)` reads back `1`
# right after `run_init()` (so the FIRST frame call after boot does run the
# real copy), but the SAME block's own tail (`sw 0x1c2c88`-`0x1c2c8b`:
# `I4 = 0x2567dc; DM(I4, M5) = M13`) writes it back to `M13`'s OWN value at
# that point, which this lane's concrete runs always find to be `0` -- so
# the gate SELF-CLEARS after one successful copy, and `img.writers()` over
# `[0x2567dc, 0x2567dd)` finds no OTHER resolved writer (several `base_only`
# candidates sit inside `unpack_track`/`FUN_1c24e9`'s own per-track decode
# body, `sw` 0x1c255e-0x1c25cd, close enough to be plausible but not
# resolved to this exact byte within this lane's budget). Real hardware
# must re-arm this every completed transfer, the same way it re-arms the
# receive descriptor itself -- most likely the same opaque ADI SSL ISR
# dispatch `FUN_1c77b4` is reached through, not visible SHARC code. Per
# this project's own rule against guessing an unresolved trigger (docs/
# findings/06's Lane E2 made the same call for the mix gate and the
# companding record's own writer), `drive_dma_completion()` below pokes
# this byte back to nonzero explicitly, alongside the ping-pong toggle, as
# the most faithful stand-in this lane could build for "the DMA-completion
# event this project cannot single-step into" -- documented here as an

    NATIVE (little-endian) narrow read recovers the ColdFire's own
    big-endian-sent value, the same way `frame_command()`'s existing
    `_u16be()` convention already assumes for the wire bytes themselves.
    This is applied uniformly to the whole transfer (every per-track field
    docs/findings/04 documents is itself 16-bit), not only the command
    header -- **[O]**: the exact receive-side hardware/DMA mechanism that

# "(sw)" instruction resolves (confirmed empirically: identical instruction

#
# **[C] Lane F2 (2026-09-26): NEITHER entry is actually about missing frame
# data -- both are `tools/sharc_core` gaps, confirmed present even with a
# REAL captured RX frame (out/captures/dt2-1.16-play-pretracks-fulltx.dt2cap,
# frame 20, track 2, master-bus table UNMASKED so the real per-track gain
# table is nonzero).** This corrects the two entries' own comments below,
# which described the ORIGINAL (all-empty synthetic frame) hypothesis before
# this lane checked it against real data; both forks recur at the identical
# pc with identical evidence once real data is present, so the original
# "this lane's synthetic frame never populated it" framing undersold the
# actual cause. A breakpoint at each fork's own upstream write (`0xb88e47`,
# `0x1c4965`) and a direct read of the live symbolic registers there
# (`Runner.state.uregs`, not `img.print_slice()`'s own separate STATIC
# slice, which reports a different, looser "[unresolved: ...]" for values
# a backward slice can't follow past a call boundary) shows precisely:
#
# - `0xb88e4b` (the `0x1C2FEC` entry): `R8` (the divisor a shared
#   recips-based fixed-point divide helper, `FUN_b88e04`, receives) is a
#   genuine, concrete `Const(0)` -- one of the OTHER 15 tracks this real
#   capture's kit does not assign a machine to legitimately has zero gain,
#   same as the empty synthetic frame did. `recips(0.0)` is well-defined
#   (PRM p.19-16: +-zero input -> +-infinity, PRM p.417-418's own
#   IEEE-754-compatibility rules), but the Newton-Raphson refinement that
#   follows propagates that infinity into a NaN (`infinity * 0.0` inside the
#   helper's own iteration), and `tools/sharc_core`'s `fix()` handler
#   (`compute_alu.py`) has no modeled saturation rule for a NaN/infinity
#   input (`Unknown(reason='fix F0 (unsaturated NAN/infinity fix)')`) --
#   real SHARC+ hardware has a documented saturated result for this case
#   (PRM's own IEEE-754-compatibility section), `tools/sharc_core` just
#   does not implement it yet. Real per-track gain data does not remove
#   this: every genuinely-silent track (15 of 16, in this real capture)
#   hits the identical zero-divisor case a real device would also see, so
#   the gap is inherent to the FIX-of-non-finite path, not to a data gap
#   this lane could fill by tracing further.
# - `0x1c4969` (the `0x1C4965` entry): `F4`/`F6` are Unknown, and the write
#   at `0x1c4965` traces (through `F15=fsub(F15,F7)`, `F2=F10*F15`,
#   `F4=fmax(F2,F13)`) to `Unknown(reason='bitext: undefined (bitlen 95 >

#   than 32 bits, hit while `FUN_1c4afe` (one of the four Step/Positions
#   setters, called from `FUN_1c642a`'s own per-voice "Trigger" dispatch

#   the fork's own call stack: `FUN_1c75d8 -> FUN_1c2b24 -> FUN_1c642a ->
#   FUN_1c4afe -> FUN_1c4914`) derives a note/tune-interpolated value from

#   which is the same kind of guess this repo's `sharc_core`-fix rule
#   (a PRM page, a test, or a widthaudit 0-mismatch proof) exists to rule

#
# **[C] Lane G2 (2026-09-26): the `0x1C2FEC` entry is REMOVED -- its
# `tools/sharc_core` gap is fixed.** `tools/sharc_core/floats.py`'s
# `_float_to_fixed`/`_double_to_fixed` (the shared FIX/TRUNC[ BY RY]
# helper) now implements the SC58x/2158x PRM's own FIX/TRUNC pages verbatim
# (out/refs/sc58x-2158x-prm/all.txt pp.20-11..20-14 for the 32-bit forms,
# pp.20-28..20-32 for the 64-bit `Fx:y` forms -- identical wording on all
# six pages): a NAN input is unconditional on MODE1.ALUSAT ("A NAN input
# returns a floating-point all 1s result" is its own sentence, not part of
# the following "If saturation mode is not set" clause) and returns
# `0xFFFFFFFF` with `invalid=True` either way; an infinity input or a
# result that numerically overflows saturates to `0x7FFFFFFF`/`0x80000000`
# when ALUSAT=1 (`invalid=False`, since the AI bullet's infinity/overflow
# clause is itself gated "when saturation mode is not set") or returns the
# same `0xFFFFFFFF` all-1s pattern with `invalid=True` when ALUSAT=0 (see
# `_float_to_fixed`'s own docstring for the full flag derivation). Checked
# live: removing this entry and re-running the SAME real-frame call this
# table's own module note above describes (capture
# `dt2-1.16-play-pretracks-fulltx.dt2cap`, frame 20, track 2, master-bus
# table masked) reaches the identical final halt ("return without followed
# call" at `0x1c75d3`) as with the entry present -- the fork at `0xb88e4b`
# no longer occurs because `fix()` on the genuine `Const(0)`-divisor NaN
# now resolves to a concrete `0xFFFFFFFF` instead of `Unknown`. The
# instruction count differs slightly (82,325 vs. 82,263 -- the real
# `0xFFFFFFFF`/AI=1 result take a different, but still successful, path
# than this entry's own arbitrary `0x4000` override did), so
# `RealFrameRingAMilestoneTest`'s own ring-A digest changes too (see
# `tests/test_sharc_harness.py`'s own note on that hash for why -- an
# intended fix, not a regression).
#
# **[C] Lane G2: `0x1C4965` stays, and corrects docs/findings/06's own
# "BITEXT, still open" `[V]` claim that "the BITEXT result R0 from the
# call at 0x1c4949 is overwritten before use."** That claim is INCOMPLETE,
# not a false trace: a live, single-instruction-stepped register trace
# through this exact fork (capture/frame/track as above, `0x1C4965`
# removed) shows `R0` genuinely does get a fresh value from the
# `Rn=comp(Rx,Ry); Rm=Rn`-shaped instruction at `0x1c4950` (form
# `5a_move`) that follows the `CALL 0xb88f70` at `0x1c4949` -- but
# `forms_move.py`'s own `_type_5a_move` comment ("The Type 5a data move and
# compute both consume the pre-instruction file") means the PARALLEL
# `R15 = R0` ureg-copy in that SAME instruction reads `R0`'s
# PRE-instruction value, not the compute's newly written one. Traced live:
# `0xb88fa4` (inside `FUN_b88f70`, the call target -- a leading-zero-count/
# normalize helper, not the fixed-point divide `0xb88e04` unrelated to it)
# is a genuine `BITEXT (NU)` (shiftimm opcode `0x19`) with `BITLEN12=95`
# (one of docs/findings/06's own five sightings), written to `R0` as
# `FUN_b88f70`'s own return value; `0x1c4950`'s `R15 = R0` copies that
# SAME still-`Unknown('bitext: undefined (bitlen 95 > 32)')` value into
# `R15` BEFORE `0x1c4950`'s own compute half gets to overwrite `R0` --
# confirmed by a register snapshot at every intervening pc: `R15` reads
# `Unknown('bitext: ...')` starting at `0x1c4953` (the very next step),
# then flows `F15=fsub(F15,F7)` (`0x1c4961`), `F2=F10*F15` (`0x1c495a`,
# `R10` itself a genuine, unrelated `Const`), `F4=fmax(F2,F13)`
# (`0x1c4963`), into the fork's own `F6=fcomp(F6,F4)` at `0x1c4965` --
# matching lane F2's own trace element for element. So the earlier "[V]"
# framing was right that `R0` itself gets clobbered, but wrong to treat
# that as discarding the BITEXT taint: this SAME instruction is what
# smuggles it into `R15` first. **This is still not a `tools/sharc_core`
# fix this lane may make**: PGR p.11-91 documents `BITLEN12 > 32` as
# "prohibited" for BITEXT's own FEXT-based pseudocode step and says only
# that SV is set, without documenting what numeric result (if any) real
# silicon produces for that width -- unlike the FIX/TRUNC NaN/infinity
# case above, there is no PRM/PGR page to cite for a specific value here,
# so implementing one would be exactly the undocumented guess this
# project's own rule (a PRM page, a test, or a widthaudit 0-mismatch
# proof) exists to rule out. The frame path's pitch bug (`FIELD_PHASE`
# advancing a fixed 40.43 samples/frame regardless of `pitch_step`,
# docs/findings/06 lane E1) is therefore UNCHANGED: `0x1C4965`'s forced
# `1.0f`/`1.0f` operands still discard the real (buggy) Positions
# computation every frame, so `render_frames_to_ring_a()`'s frame-path
# output still does not match `check_correctness()`'s `freq * pitch_step`.

# in FRAME_PATCH_TABLE because forcing it this way desyncs the run rather
# than fixing it (see this module's own handover). Confirmed root cause
# (not a hypothesis): forms_system.py's `_type_18a` bit-test handler
# (`bop in (4, 5)`) requires `isinstance(source, Const)` to produce a
# concrete BTF -- it never uses `_astatx_known_bit()`-style per-bit
# reasoning against a `PartialConst` source, so once ASTATX carries even
# one unrelated unknown bit (near-universal after any float op; confirmed
# by this lane: the tested bit itself, AI, was concretely known here) a
# `bit-test`/`xor-test` against ASTATX/ASTATY always reports Unknown. This
# is a `tools/sharc_core` gap this lane must not fix itself -- report it
# instead: `_type_18a` (tools/sharc_core/forms_system.py, the `bop in (4,
# 5)` branch) should determine `result` from the PartialConst's own
# mask/bits over exactly `mask`'s bits when `source` is a `PartialConst`,
# falling back to Unknown only when a bit `mask` needs is itself
# unresolved -- the same reasoning `_astatx_known_bit()` already applies
# one bit at a time. Setting this lane's diagnostic patch
# (`{"ASTATX": 0x400}` at 0x1c0885, replacing ASTATX with a plain Const
# that happens to match its own known bits) does get past 0x1c088e, but
# the run then hits a "return-mismatch" category a few hundred thousand
# instructions later (0xb82a08, a repeated call stack entry suggesting an
# IIR/limiter loop) -- discarding ASTATX's other tracked bits this way
# desyncs a later branch, not a step toward the frame returning. Left out

# fresh_call_state()/Runner.fresh_call() (return_address=None, see its own

#
# Every render_frames()/render_frames_to_ring_a() run above (and
# FRAME_PATCH_TABLE/CONTINUOUS_MIX_SCALAR_PATCH) was built against a
# completely EMPTY RX frame: setup_frame() only ever poked the three
# command-dispatch cells, never anything in [0x2558dc, 0x2560de) itself. Per
# this repo's scratchpad STATE.md ("KEY" item, 2026-09-25): the master-bus
# parameter table FUN_1c207b decodes every frame (0x255fb6-0x2560d0) and the
# per-track mix-gate source FUN_1c207b's own dispatch masks come from
# (0x255908-0x25600a) are BOTH inside that 2,050-byte RX frame at 0x2558dc
# (offsets 0x6da-0x7f4 and 0x2c-0x72e respectively) -- so every prior
# "reads all zero" finding about those tables was reading an RX frame this
# project never populated, not a property of the firmware. The functions
# below load real RX frame bytes from a tools/sharc_capture_run.py capture

# before FUN_1c15e3 returns -- confirmed by execution, see that function's
# own docstring).
#
# **This lane's own whole-image writer/reader scan (tools/sharc.py's
# writers()/readers(), not just run_init()'s own reach) finds one more
# writer and two more readers of DM(0x252d3c), none reported before:**
#
#   - A writer at 0x1cdc23 (``DM(I3, M6) = R11``, I3 = the passed-in
#     0x252d3c pointer), inside FUN_1cdbb2 (0x1cdbb2-0x1cdcab) -- an
#     IIR/all-pole recursion this lane did not fully characterize. It is
#     reached only dynamically, through FUN_1c642a's own out-of-line
#     dispatch FUN_1c71ec and two nested jump tables (0x8055c840 ->
#     0x8055c858 -> 0x8055c874, whose index 1 selects FUN_1cdbb2 --
#     docs/findings/06's "Table 0x8055c874 picks one stage per slot type"),
#     for whatever per-track "slot type" selects that stage -- which is why
#     ``img.callers()`` reports none (a real indirect-call gap, not
#     evidence this path is dead: see this repo's CLAUDE.md). Every capture
#     this project has (idle and play) reads every track's own machine
#     type/selector fields as 0, so this path was never exercised by
#     execution here, and this lane could not reach it from a synthetic
#     frame either (see the report). Reported as [O], not adopted.
#   - Two readers, previously undocumented: 0xb82696 (FUN_b82680, an
#     "orchestrator/dispatcher" in the same block group as the dynamics
#     stage) and 0xb82d54 (FUN_b82d41, the thin wrapper `0x1c207b` calls
#     as `0xb82d41 -> 0xb82cba`, docs/findings/06's "dynamics [D]" stage --
#     confirmed by disassembly: ``R0 = DM(I4, M5)`` at 0xb82d54, I4 = the
#     caller's R12 = the same 0x252d3c pointer, pushed as one of
#     FUN_b82cba's own stack arguments). So this word is not read only by
#     FUN_1c642a's accumulate gate: the dynamics/compressor stage consumes
#     it too. This lane's own experiment (see the report) is consistent
#     with FUN_b82cba's envelope math going degenerate when this input is
#     0 -- a hand-set-nonzero gate reached a NEW, unresolved fork
#     (FUN_b8037f, blk69) instead of restoring multi-frame signal, so this
#     is reported as a plausible explanation, not a fix.
#
# **This lane's own execution trace also corrects one specific claim in
# docs/findings/06's own "[V]" description of the accumulate loop.** A
# concrete, register-level single-step of 0x1c6b3c-0x1c6b8a (patched so
# DM(0x252d3c) reads 1, avoiding the skip) shows R8 -- the operand
# docs/findings/06 calls "per voice/track index R8" -- staying the SAME
# constant (0) for all 32 hardware DO-loop iterations; nothing in the loop
# body ever increments it. The per-iteration axis is instead I4, which
# walks a 32-entry workspace *pointer table* at 0x24ef2c (matching
# docs/findings/06's own "I5 = DM(I6-4) + 0xdc64 = 0x24ef2c" workspace
# confirmation), and the writes this lane observed through it land in
# per-voice SDRAM addresses (e.g. 0x8045b3c0 for voice 0 -- in the same
# 0x8045.... range as the documented voice sample pointer), not in
# 0x252df8 + t*0x100 (the master-stage per-track buffer). This needs a
# second agent's check before correcting docs/findings/06 -- it may mean
# the loop is walking *voices*, writing each one's own decimator-state
# scratch (record +0x104's target), rather than the master-stage per-track
# sum this lane initially assumed from the doc's own framing; reported
# here, not adopted as a doc correction, since this lane's own DM(0x252d3c)
# value (1) may not be the real one the doc's own confirmatory run used.
#
# **Given the above, this lane could not establish a real runtime path
# that sets DM(0x252d3c) to a value that both (a) avoids a new fork and
# (b) makes FUN_1c642a's own accumulate loop deposit a voice's decimated
# output at 0x252df8 + t*0x100.** Per this lane's own task brief ("record
# any remaining hand-set value in FRAME_PATCH_TABLE / a documented setup
# function with its evidence"), the functions below instead inject a
# voice's own ALREADY-FIRMWARE-RENDERED decimated buffer (FIELD_WORK_BUFFER,
# populated every frame by the firmware's own FUN_1c4ecf/FUN_1c4f81 call
# inside FUN_1c642a's per-voice dispatch loop -- this part needs no hand-
# set value at all) directly into one track's master-mix input, bypassing
# only the not-yet-resolved accumulate stage -- confirming, by execution,
# that the DOWNSTREAM path (track buffer -> master stage 0x1c207b -> ring
# A) is intact and unconditional once that one buffer has real content.
#
# --- Continuity across frames, root-caused (lane B2, 2026-09-25) ----------
#
# The frame-0-only problem above is NOT the "one independent post-init
# render per frame" workaround's own two original blockers (`state.trace`'s
# unbounded growth and the Type14a odd-UREG-pair stop at 0x1c32ad): both are
# fixed on this branch (7e5e8c4), and a genuinely continuous Runner (one
# `run_init()`, repeated `Runner.fresh_call()` at block_handler, checked by
# watchpoint on this lane's own multi-frame runs) now completes any number
# of frames cleanly. Ring A still goes silent from frame 1 onward anyway --
# root cause, traced with watchpoints across two frames of one continuous
# Runner (see the report):
#
# `FUN_1c207b`'s own per-track summation loop (`0x1c2353`, `DO ... UNTIL
# LCE` over all 16 tracks' `0x252df8`-range input) multiplies every track's
# contribution by three scalar coefficients held in R1/R2/R12 for the whole
# loop. Those scalars are computed a few hundred instructions earlier
# (`0x1c22d7`-`0x1c2353`) from `FUN_b82d41`/`FUN_b82cba`'s dynamics/
# compressor stage output (`0x254978`/`0x2549f8`, fed by `DM(0x252d3c)` --
# docs/findings/06's still-open mix gate) and from a ~26-field master-bus
# parameter block this SAME function decodes fresh every frame at
# `0x1c2e00`-`0x1c2fb0` (source table `0x255fb6`-`0x2560d0`; confirmed by
# execution to read all zero from a synthetic `run_init()` state -- no real
# kit/mixer configuration is ever loaded here). Frame 0's own compressor
# output is a plausible near-unity gain/trim (R1=0.953, R2=0.984,
# R12=-0.029 as IEEE floats); by frame 1 it has collapsed to a degenerate
# all-zero-multiplier state, independent of the injected signal's own
# amplitude (checked: scaling the injected tone down 10x does not change
# this). **This is real firmware behaviour given this lane's own state (a
# synthetic frame with a blank master-bus parameter table and no real
# per-track "slot type" ever reaching `FUN_1cdbb2`, docs/findings/06's mix
# gate), not an emulator bug**: with a genuinely unconfigured mix bus, the
# compressor's own steady state is silence, and frame 0 is riding on one
# frame's worth of "not yet converged" grace period, not a working master
# bus.
#
# **Hand-set value (documented hypothesis, not a discovered real gate).**
# Fully deriving the real per-frame scalars needs the master-bus parameter
# table's own bit layout and `FUN_b82cba`'s own 5-stage recursive state --
# out of this lane's own budget (see the report's "Open" section). Pinning
# R1/R2/R12 to frame 0's own real, execution-confirmed values at every
# recurrence of `pc=0x1c2353` -- the same "register-only override at one
# pc" technique docs/findings/06 already recommends for this exact
# situation, via the same `PatchTable` mechanism `FRAME_PATCH_TABLE` already
# uses -- keeps the compressor's own downstream multiply-accumulate at its
# frame-0 output indefinitely. This is a static, pc-keyed patch applied
# automatically every time this pc recurs (`sharc_survey.apply_patches()`),
# not a per-frame reset performed by this module's own Python loop: the
# cause (a value this lane could not derive) is what gets a fixed
# assumption, not the Runner's state. Known limitation: this freezes the
# compressor's own gain at whatever it computed for frame 0's specific
# transient, so it does not adapt to a different injected level the way a
# real compressor would -- checked and accepted for this lane's own
# single-tone deliverable, not a general fix.

# --- Why the track buffer never reaches the master mix as audio (lane D1,
# 2026-09-25), and injecting past it instead -----------------------------
#
# `inject_track_buffer()`'s own format/address assumption (32 planar L
# floats then 32 planar R floats at `0x252df8 + t*0x100`, `TRACK_MIX_BASE`
# above) is CORRECT -- confirmed by execution: `FUN_1c207b`'s own per-track
# dispatch loop (`0x1c20e7`-`0x1c212a`, a `DO...UNTIL LCE` over all 16
# tracks) walks `I13` from `TRACK_MIX_BASE` in `TRACK_MIX_STRIDE` steps and
# reads/writes exactly the byte offsets `track_mix_address()` computes.
# **The problem is downstream of that: this loop's own per-track branch
# never carries the track's own sample VALUES into the master mix at all,
# under any of the three states this lane exhaustively tried.** Per track,
# `R2` (the loop counter, 0..15) is bit-tested against two masks read once
# per track: `R8 = DM(0x252728)` (`0x1c20e7`) and `R4 = DM(0x252538)`
# (`0x1c20b9`), giving exactly three outcomes, all checked by execution
# with watchpoints on `0x252df8`-`0x253df8` and `0x25f180`-`0x25f280`:
#
#   1. `btst(R8, R2)` bit set -> `JUMP IF NOT SZ` (`0x1c20f4`) skips
#      straight to `0x1c2121` (next track): the track buffer is never
#      touched at all.
#   2. Bit clear in (1), then `btst(R4, R2)` bit clear -> `JUMP IF SZ`
#      (`0x1c20f9`) falls through into `FUN_1c238a` (`0x1c245b`, reached by
#      a plain in-function JUMP, not a CALL -- `tools/sharcdb.py`'s own
#      function-boundary split puts it in a *different* `functions` row,
#      which is why an earlier pass of this lane's own pc-range filter
#      wrongly reported zero track-buffer activity here). This is the
#      DEFAULT outcome from any synthetic `run_init()` state (both masks
#      read all-zero -- see below), and it DOES read the track buffer
#      (confirmed: `0x1c246c`/`0x1c2472` fire on `DM(0x252df8)` range with
#      no patches at all).
#   3. Bit clear in (1), bit set in (2) -> falls through to `0x1c20fc`,
#      the "normal" path this lane originally assumed was the summer: also
#      reads the track buffer (via a hand patch setting `DM(0x252538)`
#      bit 0, since it never happens by default).
#
# Both (2) and (3) run the SAME 16-iteration copy idiom (`0x1c2106`-
# `0x1c211b` / `0x1c2466`-`0x1c247b`): per iteration the loop advances its
# own OWN track-side pointer by only 2 words (8 bytes), so across 16
# iterations it visits word offsets `{0, 2, 4, ..., 30}` of each 32-word
# channel half and NEVER `{1, 3, 5, ..., 31}` -- a real, confirmed
# half-decimation of whatever the track buffer holds. But that isn't even
# the dominant effect: dumping the copy's own destination scratch buffer
# (`0x254878` for path (3)) after a full run shows the copied VALUES are
# exactly the injected samples (still smooth, still correlated with a
# ramp/sine's own shape) -- so the copy itself is faithful, just to a
# SCRATCH buffer, not to the master mix. **The master mix's own 64 words
# are separately, unconditionally overwritten every frame by a THIRD piece
# of this same function** (`0x1c2200`-`0x1c2385`, `CALL 0xb82d41`/
# `CALL 0x1cb3d8` -- the dynamics/compressor stage docs/findings/06 and
# lane B2 already named, and the same `R1`/`R2`/`R12` scalars
# `CONTINUOUS_MIX_SCALAR_PATCH` pins), which reads/writes `DM(0x25f180)`/
# `DM(0x25f200)` directly (via `I2 = R4`, `FUN_1c207b`'s own first
# argument, confirmed `== 0x25f180` at its call site `0x1c771b`/`0x1c771e`
# in the block handler) through a recursive envelope-follower/soft-clip,
# NOT a read of the per-track copy's own destination buffer. **Proven by a
# discriminating experiment, not just by reading the disassembly:**
# injecting a CONSTANT level (0.2 into every one of a track's 64 samples)
# in place of the ramp/sine produces the SAME sparse addressing pattern
# (identical indices populated) but DIFFERENT, smoothly-decaying values at
# those indices (a decay trajectory shaped like an RC/compressor
# time-constant, not a repeated constant) -- so what reaches the master
# mix tracks the compressor's own internal envelope state, not the track
# buffer's per-sample content, regardless of stride or branch taken. Two of
# the three masks feeding this whole dispatch (`0x1c2e0e`'s own write of
# `DM(0x252728)`, `0x1c2e58`'s own write of `DM(0x252538)`) are themselves
# decoded every frame from a >0x6ac-byte span of DM memory
# (`0x255908`-`0x25600a`) that reads all-zero in every capture and every
# synthetic `run_init()` state this project has -- the same class of
# "no real kit/mixer configuration is ever loaded here" gap
# `CONTINUOUS_MIX_SCALAR_PATCH`'s own note and lane B2's report already
# flagged for the neighbouring master-bus parameter table. **This lane did
# not find a way to make the real per-track summation carry audio-rate
# content into the master mix** with the information available (the
# control table's real bit layout, and whether a genuine "no real mixer
# configured" state ever produces a clean signal on real hardware, are
# both still open -- see the report). Given that, and this lane's own
# brief (get a clean tone into ring A), the fix taken here is to inject
# PAST this entire unresolved stage, at the one place C1's own report
# already proved is a lossless, bit-exact copy of whatever the master mix
# holds (`tools/sharc_dac.py`'s own module docstring) -- the same kind of
# "bypass the not-yet-resolved stage, document the hypothesis" move
# `inject_track_buffer()` above already makes for `FUN_1c642a`'s own
# accumulate stage, one stage further downstream.
#
# `FUN_1c74a1` (the Q31/ring-A converter) is called at sw `0x1c7734`,
# inside the audio task's block handler, immediately after `FUN_1c2b24`
# (the whole render orchestrator -- `CALL` at sw `0x1c771e`, `R4 =
# 0x25f180` set at `0x1c771b`) has returned for this frame; the only code
# between those two calls (`0x1c7721`-`0x1c7731`) sets up the ring-A
# destination pointer/flag and touches nothing in `0x25f180`-`0x25f280`
# (confirmed by disassembly and by execution). A write placed exactly here
# lands after `FUN_1c207b`'s own dynamics loop has already finished
# clobbering the master mix for this frame, and before anything reads it
# back for conversion -- the same "confirmed by execution to run after
# this point" placement rule `MASTER_STAGE_CALL_PC` above already
# documents, one call frame up.
MASTER_MIX_INJECT_PC = 0x1C7734

# --- Ring A's own L channel is deliberately negated after conversion
# (lane D1, 2026-09-25; new finding, not a fix) ---------------------------
#
# The first render through `MASTER_MIX_INJECT_PC` produced a "silent" mono
# downmix (`ring_a_mono` all zero, `power_ratio` 0.0) even though
# `injected_max_abs` was clearly nonzero and `read_master_mix()` showed the
# expected samples, in BOTH the L and R halves (this lane writes the same
# value to both, matching `inject_track_buffer()`'s own mono convention).
# Traced with a write watchpoint on the ring-A destination word
# (`0x261cc8`, ring A L position 0): `FUN_1c74a1` itself stores the
# CORRECT, positive Q31 value there (confirmed: raw store value
# `214748368` for a `0.1` input, matching `0.1 * 2**31` to rounding) --
# `FUN_1c74a1`/`fix_by` is NOT the bug lane C1's own isolated test already
# said it wasn't. But a SECOND write to the SAME address happens moments
# later, before the frame's own `RETURN`: a dedicated 16-iteration loop at
# sw `0x1c758b`-`0x1c75a2` (`I4 = ring-half-offset + 0x261cc8`, i.e. the
# SAME half `FUN_1c74a1` just wrote) that does `R1 = neg(R2)` /
# `R2 = neg(R2)` on every word it touches and stores the results straight
# back -- reached unconditionally every frame between `CALL FUN_1c74a1`
# (`0x1c7734`) and `FRAME_MILESTONE` (`0x1c75d3`), confirmed by execution
# to touch only the L-channel (even) words of the half just written, never
# the R-channel (odd) ones (watched: only `0x261cc8` got a second write;
# `0x261ccc`, R position 0, got exactly one write, from `FUN_1c74a1`
# itself). **This is real, deliberate firmware code, not an emulator
# artifact** -- a plain `neg()` compute op, not a decode gap or a width
# mismatch, executed on data `FUN_1c74a1` had already written correctly.
# The most likely explanation is a genuine hardware/output convention
# (e.g. an inverting stage on the L channel only, or an intentional
# stereo-phase convention); this lane did not chase why, only confirmed
# that it happens, unconditionally, every frame, and that it means: ring
# A's own L channel is the exact negation of `read_master_mix()`'s own L
# channel, while R matches directly.
#
# **Consequence for measurement, not a bug to route around:** a coherent
# signal written identically to both master-mix channels (as
# `inject_master_mix()` does) arrives at ring A as `(-L, +R)` with equal
# magnitude -- so the OLD `ring_a_mono = 0.5*(left+right)` downmix
# `render_frames_to_ring_a()` used to compute cancels to exactly zero for
# such a signal (which is what made this lane's own first full render look
# completely silent). `render_frames_to_ring_a()` below now also returns
# `ring_a_left`/`ring_a_right` (undownmixed) so a caller measures each
# channel on its own -- exactly what the report's own brief asks for
# ("THD+N per channel") -- instead of through a downmix that assumes the
# channels are in phase. `ring_a_mono` is kept for callers that still want
# it (e.g. comparing against noise-like, non-phase-related content from an
# earlier lane), documented here as unreliable for a coherent tone.

    does; a fork this halts on is a genuinely new, unresolved gap (report

    default branch pick, since this function's whole point is to observe
    the master stage's own, unperturbed behaviour once it has real
    per-track input.

    `FRAME_BYTES`, if given (`capture_frame_bytes()`'s own return, lane E1),

    the one voice this harness itself drives via `record`.

    `read_voice_work_buffer_decimated()`, the same 32 floats

    (FRAME_BYTES) makes FUN_1c642a's own accumulate loop carry the voice
    there without this hack.

    step loop -- see the "why the track buffer never reaches the master
    mix as audio" module note above `MASTER_MIX_INJECT_PC` for why this was
    necessary to get a clean tone out of a blank synthetic frame. When
    INJECT_TRACK is False but WRITE_MASTER_MIX is still True, the voice's
    own read-only decimated output is written to the master mix directly
    (bypassing the track buffer and its gate entirely) instead of the
    track-buffer injection's own result, so the two hacks can be toggled
    independently. Pass WRITE_MASTER_MIX=False to get the old (pre-lane-D1)

    loop unconditionally either way, and pinning its own scalars is what
    keeps THAT loop itself (not our own override) from forking or

    to inject the SAME decimated samples a second time, downstream of that
    entire stage, directly into the master mix, at the point lane C1
    already proved is a lossless, bit-exact source for ring A.

    **Phase continuity comes from one long source buffer plus the voice

    the old per-frame-independent version, which needed the source tone
    itself to carry phase since every frame's record restarted at
    `start=0`).

    **CAPTURE (lane E1, 2026-09-25).** If given (an `emu.sharc_capture.load()`
    result), frame `i`'s own real RX bytes -- `capture_frame_bytes(capture,
    (capture_frame_start or find_settled_capture_frame(capture,
    min_frame=DEFAULT_CAPTURE_FRAME_INDEX)) + i)`, wrapping modulo
    `len(capture.dspi2_frames)` if `n_frames` runs past the end -- are
    written at CAPTURE_FRAME_BASE before that frame's own call (via
    `capture_frame_bytes_for_render()`, `MASK_MASTER_BUS_TABLE` -- default
    True -- zeroing MASTER_BUS_TABLE_RANGE; see that constant's own
    docstring for why: real content there deterministically trips a
    brand-new sharc_core gap on the second real-frame call), so FUN_1c642a's
    per-track dispatch and FUN_1c207b's master-stage compressor see a real
    device's own machine-type and per-track gate tables (not a blank
    synthetic frame) for every track except `voice`'s own synthetic tone.
    Without `capture` (the default, `None`), behaviour is unchanged from
    before this lane: no frame bytes are written at all.

    `INJECT_TRACK` (default True) and `WRITE_MASTER_MIX` (default True) are
    passed straight through to `call_frame_with_track_injection()` (see its
    own docstring): both True is this project's original hack combination;
    either or both False, together with `capture` given, is how this lane
    measures whether real frame data removes the need for a given hack --
    see this module's own report for the actual per-configuration results.

    **`PROVISIONAL_FORMS`/`PROVISIONAL_INTERPRETATIONS` (lane E1).** Passed
    to `run_init()` (see its own docstring), so they cover every frame this
    call makes, not just init's own run. Real CAPTURE bytes hit a genuinely
    new fork from frame 1 onward that an empty synthetic frame never
    reached: an "uncertain or undecodable form" halt at 0x1c32b0
    (`21p_undoc16`, this repo's scratchpad STATE.md's own "opt-in
    provisional interpretation ... stops at 0x1c32b1" note) -- pass
    `provisional_forms=["21p_undoc16"],
    provisional_interpretations={"21p_undoc16": "nop"}` to get past it (a
    `sharc_core`-provided, already-tested opt-in, not a fix made here); left
    off by default so a caller not using `capture` sees unchanged behaviour.

    Returns `{"ring_a_mono": [...], "ring_a_left": [...], "ring_a_right":
    [...], "per_frame": [...], "any_new_stop": bool}`; `per_frame[i]` adds
    `"track_mix_left"/"track_mix_right"` (`read_track_mix()`, TRACK's own
    master-stage input after this frame) and `"master_mix"` (`read_master_mix()`,
    64 floats) to `{"frame", "instructions", "halt", "injected_max_abs",
    "ring_a_nonzero"}`, for measuring each stage of voice -> track -> master
    -> ring A per frame, not just the final ring A output. Measure
    `ring_a_left`/`ring_a_right` separately, not `ring_a_mono` -- see the
    "ring A's own L channel is deliberately negated" module note above
    `MASTER_MIX_INJECT_PC` for why the mono downmix cancels to silence for
    a coherent tone.

    """The firmware's own polyphase coefficients (docs/findings/06's
    "Render and declick": 6 taps per phase, one per 4-byte slot, 24
    bytes/phase), as float taps (signed 32-bit fraction, value / 2**31 --
    see this lane's own finding below, correcting the previous "int16 low
    half" and "int16 high half" guesses).

    ``phases=256`` is this lane's own finding, correcting the previous
    128-phase assumption (docs/findings/06 marks the phase count "[O]";
    128 was a guess "consistent with the 128-entry tables found elsewhere
    in the render chain", not evidence about this table specifically).
    Two independent checks: (1) a concrete, register-level single-step of
    FUN_1c4f81's DO 64 loop reads the coefficient pointer I5 right after
    sw 0x1c50b6's ``modify(I5, M2)`` and finds ``(I5 - coeff_table) / 24``
    (the row this function would read) landing exactly on
    ``int(fractional_phase * 256) % 256`` for every iteration checked
    (multiple non-power-of-2 pitch_step values) -- not the "% 128" a
    128-phase table would need, and not merely double by coincidence: rows
    computed this way went as high as 230, past any 128-row table
    entirely. (2) independent of any addressing question at all, the raw
    bytes at phase index 128+k equal phase index (128-k)'s six taps in
    *reverse* (e.g. row 128 == reversed(row 120), row 127 == reversed(row
    121)) -- the textbook mirror-image second half of a linear-phase
    polyphase filter bank, and not a pattern a wrong stride into unrelated
    data would produce by chance.

    **Each 4-byte slot is one 32-bit Q31 tap, not a 16-bit tap in either
    half (this lane's own finding, 2026-09-25, correcting an intermediate
    "upper 16 bits" guess made while chasing the same evidence).** Both
    16-bit halves of every slot independently satisfy check (2)'s mirror
    property (a 32-bit-symmetric table is trivially symmetric in each half
    separately, and so is the full 32-bit value), so that check alone
    cannot tell a 16-bit-slice reading from the true 32-bit one -- it is
    necessary but not sufficient. What actually distinguishes them: a
    register-level trace of FUN_1c4f81's DO 64 loop's MAC chain
    (``tools/sharc_core/compute_mult.py``'s ``_mr_product_raw``/
    ``_mr_extract32``, already correct and unchanged by this fix) computing
    ``(sample_raw * coeff_slot_raw32 << 1) >> 32`` and comparing that to
    the emulator's own concrete SAT-MRF result for a one-tap-nonzero
    impulse case: using the coefficient slot's *full* 32-bit raw value
    (e.g. ``0x31f09d09`` = 837852425 for phase 0/tap 2) as the multiplier
    input reproduces the emulator's exact SAT-MRF integer (6392, from
    sample_raw=16384) bit-for-bit; using only the slot's upper 16 bits
    (12784, an earlier version of this finding) does not feed the real
    multiplier at all -- SHARC's ``Rn = MR (+-) Rx*Ry`` reads Rx/Ry as
    whole 32-bit registers, and ``R0 = DM(I5+2), long`` (sw 0x1c50c4) loads
    the *whole* slot into R0, not a truncated half. Treating that raw
    32-bit slot as a signed Q31 fraction (``/2**31``) then gives a *float*
    coefficient that, multiplied by the sample as a plain float product
    (this module's ``reference_render``), reproduces the fixed-point
    result to about 2e-5 -- consistent with the one real remaining gap:
    ``_mr_extract32``'s bits-63:32 extraction is a PRM-documented *floor*,
    not a round (p.3-10: "using bits 63-32 for a fractional result"), so a
    pure-float reference is architecturally unable to match it bit-exactly
    without reimplementing the same truncation. The earlier "upper 16
    bits" reading was closer to that *already-truncated* single-tap
    result by coincidence (discarding the coefficient's own low 16 bits
    happens to land near where the hardware's own floor lands for some
    but not all sample/coefficient magnitudes) but is off by 4-8x more
    than the Q31 reading once several taps sum together (this lane's own
    ``check_correctness()`` run: max error dropped from ~1.1e-4 to ~3e-5,
    the SAT floor's own ~1-ULP-of-Q15 floor this module's tests assert
    once this fix landed). See
    ``/private/tmp/claude-501/-Users-em-src-digi-digitakt2/89c5e6c8-2a58-496e-84a0-527f96e6f55a/scratchpad/verify_fixedpoint.py``
    and ``verify_q31.py`` for the traces this is drawn from. This was the
    residual this lane's task brief pointed at ("this lane's evidence
    points at tools/sharc_core's MR-accumulator housekeeping ... and/or
    float_by ... not at this harness's own sample encoding or
    addressing") -- neither of those was actually at fault (both verified
    correct by direct trace); this function's own coefficient extraction
    was.

    record field persists across ``call_render()`` calls -- so this checks

    advancing by pitch_step*64 per block, matching the DO 64 loop's 64

    samples of buffer *past* the last one a block actually reads, not the

    case (0.5x) silently deactivated the last of 8 blocks at 1x and 2x
    (this module's own test asserts against that regression). This sizes
    for one whole extra block at this case's own pitch_step, which covers
