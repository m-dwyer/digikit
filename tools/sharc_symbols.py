"""Resolve SHARC+ program addresses from tools/sharcdb.py's database, instead
of hardcoding them per firmware build -- the SHARC-side counterpart to
emu/symbols.py, which does this for the ColdFire main OS. Read that module's
docstring first: the same idea (fixed anchors verified by content, everything
else found by what it looks like or how it is reached from something already
resolved, REQUIRED fails loudly at resolve() time, OPTIONAL degrades to None)
applies here with three SHARC-specific primitives instead of ColdFire's:

    * FuncMatch: a function identified by tools/sharcdb.py's relocation-
      tolerant `func_hash` (same instruction sequence with every relocatable
      address field masked to zero) against a REFERENCE image, DT2 1.16 --
      the SHARC analogue of a masked-signature `Sig`, except the "signature"
      is a whole function's shape rather than a byte string, and the search
      is one query against an index instead of a scan.
    * LiteralAt: a literal value decoded by tools/sharcdb.py's own typed
      instruction reader, at a fixed word (`sw`) offset from an
      already-resolved function's entry -- the SHARC analogue of
      emu.symbols.Operand, except the literal is read from the `literals`
      table (already sign-extended and int-valued by the decoder) rather
      than re-parsed from raw bytes.
    * IVTSlot: a populated slot of the L1 hardware interrupt vector table,
      read from `roots` (kind='interrupt_vector') -- this needs no
      reference image at all: the IVT layout is RTOS/hardware structure,
      not application code, and it comes straight out of the DB the same
      way for every image.

Why the offset in LiteralAt is safe to carry across images: `func_hash`'s
reloc_hash is a SHA-256 over the function's instructions with every
'addr'/'reladdr'/'data' field zeroed (tools/sharcdb.py's mask_relocatable),
concatenated in instruction order. Two functions can only hash equal if they
have the same instruction count AND the same per-instruction byte length in
the same order -- so once a reloc_hash match pins down a target function's
entry_sw, every instruction inside it sits at the same word offset from
entry as it does in the reference. That is what lets LiteralAt jump straight
to a computed `sw` in a brand new image and expect a literal to be sitting
there. Spot-checked directly against dn2-1.11: at every LiteralAt offset
used below, the DN2 image has a literal of the *same form* (17a/19a/14a) as
DT2 at that exact computed `sw`, carrying DN2's own (different) address.

REQUIRED_COMMON symbols exist on both known devices: the audio task/command
dispatch machinery and the ring buffers it drives, plus the shared SIMD
helper and the SECI interrupt entry. REQUIRED_DT2 adds the DT2 (Digitakt)
sample-playback voice engine -- render_frame's per-track loop, the per-slot
dispatcher, the decimator, and the data structures reached from them. DN2
(Digitone, an FM engine) genuinely does not have most of that: `resolve()`
still probes every DT2-only rule on a dn2-* image (so Profile.report() shows
what a device lacks, not just what it needed), but only fails the run when a
symbol REQUIRED for that specific device is missing. An unresolved or
ambiguous REQUIRED symbol raises SymbolResolutionError naming exactly which
symbol(s) and why.

    uv run python -m tools.sharc_symbols dt2-1.16      # print the resolution table
    uv run python -m tools.sharc_symbols dn2-1.11 --device dn2

Nothing here reads the firmware blob: every rule is a query against the
already-built out/sharcdb/<image>.sqlite (tools/sharc.py's `sharc.load`), so
this module works wherever that database does.
