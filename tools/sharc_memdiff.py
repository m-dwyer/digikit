"""Replay two tools/sharc_capture_run.py captures in lockstep from the same
post-init state (tools/sharc_replay.py's own setup convention: one hand-set-up
voice, real DMA delivery) and diff the two runners' DM state after every
frame.

    uv run python tools/sharc_memdiff.py dt2-1.16 CAPTURE_A.dt2cap \
        CAPTURE_B.dt2cap [--frames A:B] [--only-first-divergence] [--json]

Both captures are replayed continuously from frame 0 (no start_frame
shortcut: this tool always executes every frame up to the top of --frames,
or the whole capture if --frames is not given -- only *reporting* is
windowed), through the exact same setup tools/sharc_replay.replay() uses
(sharc_harness.run_init() -> sharc_harness.new_runner() -> one hand-set-up
voice 0 with a --freq Hz sine -> sharc_harness.setup_frame_dma()) and the
exact same per-frame delivery (sharc_harness.write_dma_transfer()/
drive_dma_completion(), then tools/sharc_replay.call_frame_collect_all_with_hits()
under sharc_harness.FRAME_PATCH_TABLE) -- two independent Runners, one per
capture, advanced one frame at a time so a diff at frame N compares state
built from exactly N+1 frames of each capture's own real TX content on top
of an otherwise identical start.

After each frame this tool cares about (see --frames/--only-first-divergence
below), it diffs:

- `state.overlay` (a dict of byte address -> value): the union of every
  address either run has ever written, un-aliased the same way
  tools/sharc_inputs.py's dynamic_view() does (an address below
  sharcldr.SW_ALIAS_BASE may be stored at that raw address or at
  SW_ALIAS_BASE+address depending on which was already "present" at write
  time -- sharc_core.memory._canonical_dm_address()'s own docstring; both
  resolve to the same un-aliased address here), read back through
  sharc_trace._dm_read() (which already knows this same resolution) rather
  than compared as raw dict values, so a byte only one side ever wrote is
  still compared correctly against the other side's loader-backed default.
  Differing addresses are coalesced into contiguous ranges, and each range
  is labelled by whichever known structure (voice records, the RX frame
  copy, the command/TX ring pages, the master mix, ring A, the per-track
  mix buffers, or the guard arrays -- see REGIONS below) it falls inside,
  or "unlabeled" if it falls outside all of them.
- `state.mmrs` (a dict of MMR address -> Value): compared by rendered value
  (sharcimm.name_address() for a friendly label when one exists), not
  address presence alone.

This tool never edits sharc_core, sharc_harness.FRAME_PATCH_TABLE, or any
other lane's file: it only drives tools/sharc_replay.py's existing replay
primitives with a second, independent Runner alongside the first.
