    compute_shift.py/compute_multi.py/forms_system.py, which is where each
    of these actually gets applied:

      - A COMPUTE_FORMS instruction's parallel compute field: classified
        exactly the way tools/sharcdb.py's own `_compute_regdef_reguse`
        does, through the same tools/sharcinv.classify_compute() (PRM Table
        18-5/18-9/18-18/18-19 by the field's own cu/opcode bits) --
        'ALU'/'MULT'/'SHIFT' map directly; 'MULTIFN' (a MUL+ALU or
        MUL+dual-add/subtract multifunction op) always touches both ALU
        (the ALU sub-op's own flags, PRM's "flags from the ALU op") and
        MULT (compute_multi.py always also forgets MN/MV/MU/MI, since the
        multiplier result format is unmodelled for a multifunction op too)
        -- including a MULTIFN row tools/sharcdb.py itself leaves as
        `unknown: multifn_alu_compute` for its DATA effect (the ALU sub-op's
        variable-width operand table isn't modelled there), since the flags
        effect is unconditional regardless of whether the data effect could
        be named.
      - Type2c's 12-bit short-compute field (never in COMPUTE_FORMS):
        opcode 0x7/0xF (mul_ssi/fmul) is MULT; every other opcode there
        (add/sub/pass/comp/not/inc/dec/fadd/fsub/float/fcomp) is ALU.
      - Type6a_mem's ShiftImm sub-instruction (PRM Table 18-9): always
        SHIFT for a recognised opcode (tools/sharcfn._SHIFTIMM_MNEMONICS),
        including btst (register bit-test sets SZ, PRM p.513 -- an entirely
        different flag from Type18a's BTF below) and the "[status only]"
        case tools/sharcdb.py's own `_shiftimm_regdef_reguse` leaves with no
        data regdef row at all.
      - Type18a's system bit-test/xor-test (bop 4/5, forms_system.py's
        `_type_18a`): BTF. tools/sharcdb.py's `register_effects` records no
        regdef row for this case either (it only reads its source register
        into BTF, never writes one) -- the gap the frame-render survey
        found: a slice for a BTF-reading branch used to walk back through
        the block's last *unrelated* compute (any kind='compute' regdef, on
        the old whole-ASTAT rule) instead of the real Type18a bit-test.

    Returns () for a compute field this file/tools/sharcdb.py doesn't model
    at all (field absent/zero, or an sharcinv.classify_compute() cu this
    table has no PRM-sourced group for -- 'CU3' -- or a Type6a_mem opcode
    outside _SHIFTIMM_MNEMONICS): left unmodelled, not guessed, exactly like
    tools/sharcdb.py's own regdef/reguse `unknown` tags.

    # so a slice for a BTF-reading branch (reg="ASTAT.BTF") walks back only
    # through a real Type18a bit-test/xor-test, never an unrelated ALU/MULT/
    # SHIFT compute that is architecturally unable to touch BTF (PRM: "BTF

        def -> use, labelled reg=<register, _ASTAT, or one of _ASTAT_GROUPS'

        standard forward reaching-definitions dataflow (gen/kill per
        instruction, meet=union, iterated to a fixpoint over cfg()'s cycles
        -- a hardware DO loop's loop_back edge is just another predecessor
        at that point, no special-casing needed) with two SHARC-specific
        gen/kill rules:

          - A conditionally-executed def (insn.cond real, not
            sharcfn.ALWAYS_TRUE_COND -- a Type2a-family IF-cond compute, a
            conditional memory form, or a hardware-loop DAG modify) is a
            may-def: it ADDS itself to the reaching set for that register
            rather than replacing it (an unconditional def replaces/kills).
            The same insn.cond also generates a use of the whole-register
            _ASTAT pseudo-register AND of the specific _ASTAT_GROUPS
            pseudo-register(s) that cond's own bit(s) read (see
            _cond_astat_groups()) at that sw, so a conditional branch's or
            store's condition source shows up in the graph like any other
            input -- and a slice by the precise group (reg="ASTAT.BTF")
            never drags in an unrelated compute's ALU/MULT/SHIFT flags, or
            vice versa.
          - Any instruction whose own decoded form/fields write one of
            _ASTAT_GROUPS (see _astat_groups_written(): every COMPUTE_FORMS
            compute, Type2c's short compute, Type6a_mem's ShiftImm, and
            Type18a's system bit-test/xor-test -- independent of whether
            regdef itself has a row there, which it does not for a
            "[status only]" ShiftImm or a bit-test/xor-test, both of which
            read a source into a flag but write no data register) is a def
            of that group's pseudo-register AND of _ASTAT. An explicit move
            into ASTATX/ASTATY (already an ordinary regdef row for that
            named ureg, kind 'move'/'literal') is a def of every group at
            once, since it overwrites the whole register.
          - A CALL site (edges.kind='call') has no regdef row of its own
            (register_effects() models no register effect for a call), so
            it is never a kill here either -- definitions from before a
            call reach after it unless this file's own decode later adds a
            call regdef; there is no general caller/callee-saved convention
            recorded for this ABI to apply instead (docs/findings/06 only
            pins down R4-as-argument and explicit save/restore spills, both
            already visible as ordinary regdef/reguse rows).

        A mem_load def's node also carries a `mem` attr (see _mem_label) and
        a literal def's a `literal` attr (its value), so a slice ending at
        one prints an address/value, not just a bare sw. Delayed-branch slot
        instructions need no special handling: sharcdb.py's bblocks already
        include them as ordinary sequential instructions of the block they
        end (see its SCHEMA comment on `bblocks`).
