"""Trace every core/system MMR write a SHARC+ entry point makes from a
post-init state, naming each address against tools/sharcimm.py's peripheral
register tables (DMA channel register block layout, DMA channel ->
peripheral assignment, SPI register blocks -- ADSP-2156x SHARC+ Processor
Hardware Reference, Rev 1.0, Table 27-2 and Appendix A register lists,
out/refs/adsp-2156x-hwr).

    uv run python tools/sharc_dmamap.py IMAGE [--entry PC_SW] [--limit N]
        [--regs R4=0x1,R8=0x2,...] [--provisional FORM=MODE ...]
        [--json OUT]

Default ``--entry`` is ``0x1c7ff9``: the DMA-descriptor-driver setup path
this project's own handover traces (HANDOVER-2026-09-26-sharc-audio.md's
"Update (J1, J2, K1 and static reading)") -- reached by a plain ``JUMP``
at ``0x1c147e`` (a manual, I7-stack-based call convention this project's
own disassembly confirms neither reads nor needs R4/R8/R12 as arguments:
FUN_1c7ff9's own first few instructions overwrite all three before using
them), NOT called during ``FUN_1c15e3``'s own init. It calls ``FUN_1c7bd4``
(``0x1c80a2``, ``R4=0xabc``), which builds the two DMA descriptor rings at
DM ``0x2641b0``/``0x2641cc`` and ``0x2641e8``/``0x264204`` this project's
static reading has already found, then the "driver services" ``0x1c8e21``,
``0x1c8e9f``, ``0x1c8e8c``, ``0x1c989b`` -- none of which reference a
peripheral MMR by a literal address in FUN_1c7bd4's own body (every access
there goes through an indirect control-block pointer): this tool exists
because the *emulator* seeing the concrete addresses those indirections
resolve to is the only way to find which physical DMA channel each ring's
DSCPTR_NXT actually lands on, short of hand-tracing every driver-service
callee.

Runs from ``tools/sharc_harness.run_init()``'s post-init state via
``Runner.fresh_call()`` -- the same convention every other tool built on
this harness uses (``tools/sharc_replay.py``, ``tools/sharc_survey.py``) --
with the harness's usual ``explicit_memory_model`` already on
(``sharc_harness._make_runner()``): every DM read/write, MMR included,
is concrete or an explicit, reported stop, never a silent fork.

A run this deep into undiscovered driver code is expected to halt before
returning (an unmodeled MMR read, a fork, or an unsupported/undocumented
form): the halt is reported, not treated as a failure, and every MMR write
already made before it is still real and still printed in order.

    :class:`~tools.sharc_run.Halt` that stopped it (``None`` only if LIMIT
    was reached first, i.e. the run did not stop on its own).

    RUNNER must already have ``state.explicit_memory_model`` set (every
    entry point ``tools/sharc_harness.py`` builds already does --
    ``_make_runner()``): a bare Runner still writes ``state.mmrs`` on a
    fixed-width MMR store (``sharc_core.memory._dm_write``'s
    ``fixed_width_mmr`` branch fires regardless), but the very next
    *read* of a still-unwritten peripheral register only raises
    ``UnmodeledMMR`` -- surfaced here as a named ``Halt`` a caller can
    inspect -- when ``explicit_memory_model`` is on; off, that read
    silently forks or halts some other way before this function can even
    see the write that preceded it.

    ``state.mmrs`` is a plain ``dict`` with no history of its own:
    ``_dm_write`` replaces its entry in place (``state.mmrs[concrete] =
    value``), the same way a real MMR only ever holds its current value.
    This function recovers the write *history* the dict itself does not
    keep by snapshotting it before/after every single instruction
    (``Runner.step()``, never ``Runner.run()``: a whole run's before/after
    diff would only show the LAST value at each address, folding e.g. a
    channel enabled and then immediately reconfigured into one write) and
    comparing keys/values -- correct because ``Runner.step()``/
    ``sharc_core._execute()`` only ever mutate ``state.mmrs``'s entries,
    never replace the dict object itself.

    A single instruction that writes the same MMR address more than once
    (none of this project's known driver code does) would show as one
    write here, at that instruction's own pc, carrying only its final
    value -- the same per-step folding ``tools/sharc_run.py``'s own
    ``_WatchingOverlay.update()`` applies to a multi-byte overlay write.
