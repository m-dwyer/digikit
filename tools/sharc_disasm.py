"""Linear disassembler for SHARC+ VISA code, built on tools/sharc_visa_tables.py.

    uv run python tools/sharc_disasm.py REGION.bin [START_OFFSET]

Walks a byte buffer forward instruction by instruction and stops at the first
word it cannot classify: no form matches, several forms tie, or the buffer
ends inside the instruction. It never advances past such a word, because a
wrong length silently desyncs every instruction after it.

Memory holds 16-bit little-endian words, instructions start at even offsets,
and a 32- or 48-bit instruction stores its most significant word first:
insn = (w0 << 32) | (w1 << 16) | w2 for 48 bits, (w0 << 16) | w1 for 32.
A form whose table entry marks some fixed bits unconfirmed yields kind
"uncertain", and the walk continues.

#
# tools/sharc_isa.py's InstructionSet.select_frame() ranks matching forms by
# leading fixed bits, so a wider form whose header shares a narrower form's
# prefix always wins the tie even when every one of its confirmed bits sits
# inside the first word(s) -- it has verified nothing a narrower reading
# didn't already verify, and its "extra" word(s) are free bits that decode
# into *something* almost any time (DT2 1.16 sw 0x1c4b99: Type2b, 32 bits
# cut down to leading_fixed_bits=9, fixed_bits=9, outranks Type2c,
# fixed_bits=4, on the same word, even though the wider reading's own 6-byte
# gap only decodes as a NEVER_ALIGNED_FORMS trap; sw 0x1c4e10: the wider
# reading's extra word is provably free -- a narrower reading rejoins one of
# its own successor offsets a few instructions later).
#
# resolve_confident_width() is the one function that decides this, so a
# single-PC decode (decode_confident()/decode_confident_loaded() below, used
# by tools/sharc_core.sequencer.decode_at()) and a whole-image walk
# (tools/sharcimm.py's decode_all(), which calls resolve_confident_width()
# directly with its own memoized table as raw_at, for speed over a whole
