"""Capture real ColdFire<->SHARC DSPI2 frames (and, best-effort, SSI0 "audio
in" requests) from a running Digitakt II 1.16 snapshot, for
tools/sharc_replay.py.

    uv run python tools/sharc_capture_run.py SNAPSHOT --out CAPTURE.dt2cap \
        --kind idle|note|play --instrs N [--syx SYX] [--ssi0-hz N]
        [--trig-at N] [--force-period N] [--unblock]
        [--poke-track-type TRACK:TYPE ...] [--pre-instrs N]

Three things a run needs, all handled here:

**Getting a DSPI2 driver call to happen at all.** The vector-191 ISR
(docs/findings/04-coldfire-dsp-link.md, "The ColdFire tells the SHARC
through a periodic DSPI2 frame"; addresses from tools/framelink.py) builds
the TX payload and calls the DSPI2 driver (`FUN_400cd2bc`) with it. This
tool hooks that call directly the way tools/sharcframe.py already does
(intercept the stack args via `emu.dspiframe.read_driver_call`, fake the
return) rather than modelling eDMA/DSPI2 registers -- nothing about
capturing needs the transport modelled, only what crossed it. It also opens
the frame-build gate (docs/findings/04, "The frame capture runs; the frame
build is switched off": the long at the profile's `gate` address must be 0
or the handler sends stale/zero bytes) the same way `--open-gate` does.

Getting vector 191 to *fire*, so that call happens, is two independent
mechanisms, both always on:

1. **SSI0 model, for "audio in" only** (best-effort): `--ssi0-hz` wires up
   `emu.ssi.Ssi0Dma` via `emu.longrun.build(ssi0_request_hz=...,
   ssi0_legacy_upgrade=True)`, claiming the snapshot's already-programmed
   SSI0 TCDs (the same trick `tools/guirun.py` uses) so
   `emu.sharc_capture.CapturingPeer` can observe genuine SSI0 "audio in"
   requests (`peer.rx()`) as the run proceeds under `emu.longrun.spin()`.
   Measured on `boot400M.snap`, `--unblock` off: this reaches real
   TCD50 major-loop completions and a delivered vector 170 every time
   (`Ssi0Dma.vector170` increments normally), but the vector-170 ISR that
   ran there did not write `INTFRCH1`'s force bit even after ten
   deliveries (`Ssi0Dma.force_asserted` stayed `False` throughout) --
   so on this snapshot/config the documented "SSI0-paced eDMA50 completion
   -> vector 170 -> software-forced vector 191" chain (`emu/ssi.py`'s own
   docstring) does not by itself reach the DSPI2 driver call within a
   bounded run. Recorded here as a finding, not chased further (out of
   this lane's scope: `emu/ssi.py`/the vector-170 handler's *own*
   forward-progress conditions belong to whichever lane owns that model).
   If claiming the snapshot's SSI0 TCDs fails outright (a shape mismatch --
   `Ssi0Dma.arm_legacy()` raises `RuntimeError`), SSI0 capture is simply
   skipped; DSPI2 capture (below) never depends on it either way. Either
   outcome is recorded in the capture's own JSON header (`ssi0`: "natural"
   or "unavailable: <reason>").
2. **Forcing it directly, for DSPI2** (always on, and what actually
   produces every DSPI2 frame this tool captures): every `--force-period`
   instructions, from inside `spin()`'s own `on_chunk` hook, clear the
   handler's pacing counter and call `Machine.raise_vector(191, level=...)`
   directly -- the same "force it, run the handler like anything else"
   technique `tools/sharcframe.py` already uses for a single call/return,
   paced through the normal instruction stream here (so it shares one
   Machine and one instruction clock with kind='note' below) instead of a
   separate call/return dance per frame.

   **The repeated forcing must not re-enter the handler on top of itself.**
   Measured by execution (Lane H1): one call to `vector_191_handler`
   (`prof["handler"]`) costs on the order of 45,000-60,000 ColdFire
   instructions before it returns -- comparable to, or larger than,
   `--force-period`'s own default of 50,000. Forcing unconditionally, as
   this loop did before Lane H1, calls `Machine.raise_vector()` with no
   `level=` and no interrupt-mask check, unlike every legitimate timer
   source in this codebase (`emu.pit.Pits.service()`); it recurses into
   the still-running previous call, indefinitely, so the CPU never
   actually returns to RTOS/task code between forced frames. `on_chunk`
   now calls `ready_to_force()` (this module's own function) first and
   defers -- retrying next chunk, not dropping the frame -- when the
   current interrupt level is already at or above vector 191's own
   configured level. See docs/findings/04-coldfire-dsp-link.md, "Lane H1:
   the DSPI2 forcing loop re-entered its own handler", for the measurement
   and its consequence: fixing this alone does not make every downstream
   ColdFire task (kit-load, panel dispatch, sequencer scheduling) start
   running within a bounded capture, because a ~50,000-instruction-costing
   level-5 handler firing every `--force-period` instructions still spends
   most of the CPU's time in that one handler at the default period --
   raising `--force-period` trades frame density for RTOS progress, it
   does not remove the tension.

**Lane I1: forcing is still required from a genuinely running snapshot, not
just an artifact of never reaching one.** Every measurement above (point 1's
"did not by itself reach the DSPI2 driver call") was taken on `boot400M.snap`,
before Lane H1 established that snapshot's RTOS never actually runs (see
"Lane H1" above) -- leaving open whether the natural SSI0/vector-170 chain
would complete once a capture started from a snapshot with a genuinely
running RTOS instead. It does not: from `snapshots/dt2-1.16/running.snap`
(`tools/dt2_reach_running.py`, MAIN_OS_RUNNING per `tools/bootcheck.py`'s own
criteria), with the DSPI2 forcing loop *disabled entirely* and only the SSI0
model wired up (`--ssi0-hz 1000`, `ssi0_legacy_upgrade=True`), `Ssi0Dma`
delivered vector 170 400 times over 120,000,000 further ColdFire
instructions (~80 real board-rate periods at the placeholder 1 kHz request
rate) and `force_asserted` never once went `True` -- zero natural calls to
the DSPI2 driver (`prof["driver"]`, `FUN_400cd2bc`). So this is not "the
system was never running" the way `boot400M.snap`'s zero notes turned out to
be (Lane H1): it is a genuine gap in the vector-170 ISR model, or a real
firmware precondition for that ISR to force vector 191 that a truly-running
RTOS still does not by itself satisfy within a bounded run (the real SSI0
board clock rate is also still unrecovered -- see `emu/ssi.py`'s own
docstring -- so the *rate* of delivery, not just whether it happens, is a
further unknown). Forcing vector 191 (point 2) therefore remains the only
way this tool gets a DSPI2 frame at all, from either kind of snapshot; this
is recorded as a finding for whichever lane next owns `emu/ssi.py`'s
vector-170 handler, not fixed here.

**Starting from a snapshot with a genuinely running RTOS.** Pass
`snapshots/dt2-1.16/running.snap` (or any snapshot `tools/dt2_reach_running.py`
produced) as `SNAPSHOT` directly -- `run()` now declares
`deferred_components=('timers',)` on every `build()` call and restores the
snapshot's own Pits/Dtims cadence via `ev['restore_checkpoint_timers']()`
when it has one (falling back to a fresh `Timers` for a plain
`emu.checkpoint` ladder rung with no such component, so `boot400M.snap`
keeps working exactly as before). `running.snap`'s build manifest was saved
with `unblock=True`, so a capture resuming it must also pass `--unblock`, or
`restore_into`'s manifest check refuses the mismatch outright (a real
safeguard, not friction to route around -- see `emu.snapshot.restore_into`'s
own docstring on why a resumed run must match the configuration that
produced the snapshot). No other change is needed: kit/pattern state is
already real on `running.snap` (`--pre-instrs` is for a plain boot-ladder
rung where `KIT_LOAD_FN` has not fired yet; skip it here).

**Triggering a note deterministically, with no framebuffer reading.**
`--kind note` injects a panel "TRIG 1" press+release at ColdFire instruction
count `--trig-at` (default: a quarter of `--instrs`), via `emu/panelin.py`
(the front-panel UART8 input path -- no GPIO/key-matrix to model, see that
module's own docstring) -- the exact wire bytes
(`encode_buttons(3, 1)` then `encode_buttons(3, 0)`, delivered as one
`feed()` so the firmware's own ISR drains both from one raised vector, per
`emu/panelin.py`'s docstring) a prior lane host-replayed and confirmed reach
the firmware's real panel-input path end to end
(docs/findings/03-ui-and-panel.md, "A panel-path track trigger joins
machine invalidation to the refresh queue": panel machine commit -> ...
-> panel TRIG 1 -> record construction -> queue append -> vector 191 ->
`FUN_4002d438` -> track-0 row -> TX frame `0x94` = machine type). Track 0
in that chain is the panel's own "Track 1" (1-indexed on the hardware,
0-indexed internally) -- this is the "note triggered on track 1" this tool
captures. No UI/framebuffer read is needed: the whole chain is inferred
from the resulting TX frame bytes this tool already captures.

**Starting the sequencer instead of a single panel trigger.** `--kind play`
injects a panel "PLAY" press+release at `--trig-at` the same way (wire bytes
`encode_buttons(2, 8)` then `encode_buttons(2, 0)` -- PLAY is channel 2 bit
3, read back from the running image's own button-name table,
`emu/panelin.py`'s `control_names(m, profile, 'button')`: code 20 = "PLAY",
matching `code_for`'s `channel*8+bit+1` for channels 0-5). This does not
need a `--poke-track-type`: the snapshot's already-loaded pattern has real
active trigs on it (docs/findings/03-ui-and-panel.md, "A panel-path track
trigger joins machine invalidation to the refresh queue": the causal
control "machine change followed by `PLAY` scheduled records only for the
current pattern's tracks 3, 12, 13 and 15" -- so starting the transport on
a stock `boot400M.snap`-derived snapshot already reaches the same
record/queue path as a bare panel TRIG, for those four tracks, with no
pattern-data poke needed). Use it to test whether firmware-driven sequencer
playback reaches the SHARC by a path a single hand-pressed TRIG does not
exercise (real timing, real step advance) -- `--instrs` needs to cover at
least one full pattern loop (16 steps) for every active track to be hit at
least once; at the default tempo that is on the order of 10-20M ColdFire
instructions from the press, not the few million `--kind note` needs.

**Changing a track's machine, without re-running the real UI navigation.**
The same finding's own causal-control run (`out/experiments/a2-queue-
trigger/report.json`) already established, end to end and byte-checked,
that "machine change on track 0, then TRIG 1" is what actually flips the TX
frame's machine-type word (`0x94 + 2*track`) from `0x0000` to a real type --
"TRIG 1 without a machine change" or "machine change without TRIG 1" alone
do not. But reaching that "machine menu commit" state through the real panel
(`MACHINE SEL` chord, encoder turns, `YES`) took that prior run 46-160M
ColdFire instructions of UI navigation just to get there, before the part
this tool cares about (the DSPI2 frame) ever happens -- far more than this
capture tool's own budget. `--poke-track-type TRACK:TYPE` instead seeds the
*result* of that commit directly: the per-track machine-type mirror byte
`0x80003cd0 + track*0x9a` (`tools/framelink.py`'s `track_9a`, corrected base
per docs/findings/04) that `FUN_4002d438`/the vector-191 handler already
reads on every real commit -- the same address and mechanism
`tools/sharcframe.py` used for its own `[V]`-marked single-poke experiment
("Measured, not only read", docs/findings/04). The vector-191 handler does
not care why that byte changed; it copies it into the TX frame exactly the
same way whether a real MACHINE SEL commit, a MIDI program change, or this
poke set it. This is not synthesizing the frame -- the DSPI2 driver call is
still the real one, hooked the same way as always -- it only stands in for
the (already independently `[V]`-established, just prohibitively expensive
to re-run here) UI front-end that would normally produce that same byte
change. Combine with `--kind note` (`--trig-at`) for the full causal chain
that report.json's own `machine_trig1` run used: a poked machine change,
then a real panel TRIG 1.

**Getting the *real* per-track machine type and active flag, with no poke
at all.** Every capture this tool produced before `--pre-instrs` existed --
`--kind idle`, `--kind note`, and `--kind play` alike, on unmodified
`snapshots/dt2-1.16/boot400M.snap` -- shows every track's machine-type and
`0x73c` active fields at zero for the whole run, even though a real,
non-empty kit is already loaded at that snapshot (`_DAT_80004704` is
non-null and one track already has a real machine type; see
`run_natural_track_refresh()`'s own docstring). That data just never gets
copied into the SRAM row the TX frame is built from, because the function
that does that copy (`KIT_LOAD_FN`, `FUN_4002d9c4`) has not run yet at that
exact snapshot instant -- it fires naturally 10-12M instructions later, but
only when nothing is servicing real PIT/DTIM timer interrupts in the
meantime, which every timed capture (this tool's own `--force-period`
phase included) does. `--pre-instrs N` runs an untimed pre-phase (bounded by
N, stopped early by a code hook the moment `KIT_LOAD_FN` fires) before the
timed capture phase starts, so the row already carries the snapshot's real
per-track data -- no `--poke-track-type` needed, though the two combine
freely (poke is applied after the pre-phase, so it can still override
specific tracks on top of whatever the natural refresh produced).

    true for a single call/return, but not for the periodic forcing here.
    Measured by execution (Lane H1, boot400M.snap, no `--syx` bytes stored
    since the .syx is Elektron's copyright): one call to
    `vector_191_handler` (`prof["handler"]`) costs on the order of
    45,000-60,000 ColdFire instructions before it returns to its
    interrupted caller -- comparable to, or larger than, `--force-period`'s
    own default of 50,000. `Machine.raise_vector()` unconditionally pushes
    a fresh exception frame and jumps to the handler regardless of the
    current interrupt mask; a real DSPI2 controller signalling vector 191
    at its own configured level would not do that while the CPU is
    already servicing that same level (`emu.pit.Pits.service()` checks
    this for every legitimate timer source, via this same
    `emu.pit.interrupt_level()` -- forcing here previously did not).
    Left unguarded, the periodic force recurses into the handler on top of
    an unfinished previous call, indefinitely, so the CPU never actually
    returns to RTOS/task code between forced frames -- which starves every
    ColdFire task this project has tried to observe during a forced
    capture, not only sequencer-related ones. See docs/findings/04-
    coldfire-dsp-link.md, "Lane H1: the DSPI2 forcing loop re-entered its
    own handler".

    LEVEL is the vector's own configured INTC level (this module's own
    callers pass `interrupt_level(m, prof["vector"], respect_mask=False)`,
    read once; the mask itself is irrelevant here since this is a forced,
    not a real, delivery). `None` (the level could not be read, e.g. an
    unresolved profile) keeps the old unconditional behaviour -- silently

    """Run up to BUDGET instructions, untimed, so the real per-track
    kit-load-and-refresh (KIT_LOAD_FN's own docstring) has a chance to fire
    before the timed capture phase starts. -> the PC to resume from.

    Every capture this project has produced before this function existed
    used ``snapshots/dt2-1.16/boot400M.snap`` unmodified: at that exact
    point the live kit pointer (``_DAT_80004704``) is already set to a real,
    non-null project (one track already carries a real machine type, and
    every other per-track object already holds plausible non-default
    parameter bytes -- this is not an empty/unloaded project), but the SRAM
    mirror row the TX frame is built from is still at its zero-initialized
    reset value: KIT_LOAD_FN has not run since boot, so nothing has ever
    copied that real data into the row. Confirmed by execution: resuming
    ``boot400M.snap`` for 10-12M further ColdFire instructions, with no
    panel input and no forced vector 191, reaches KIT_LOAD_FN exactly once,
    which calls ROW_REFRESH_FN for all 16 tracks and makes the mismatch
    disappear (the row byte for the one track with a real machine type
    changes from 0 to that type).

    This needs its own untimed, pits-less phase because the interaction is
    with time-of-check, not just elapsed instructions: the same resume
    driven through ``emu.longrun.spin()`` with a real
    ``emu.dtim.Timers``/``emu.pit.Pits`` object servicing PIT/DTIM
    interrupts -- what every capture/replay tool in this project, including
    this module's own timed capture phase below, normally does -- did not
    reach KIT_LOAD_FN within at least 60M further instructions in the same
    control. Only removing the PIT/DTIM timer service (not chunking, not
    the SSI0 model, not the idle-yield reschedule ``emu.longrun.build()``
    always installs -- each checked in isolation) restores the ~12M timing.
    Why real PIT/DTIM service changes which task the guest OS schedules
    enough to block or badly delay this one function was not chased further
    here: this pre-phase is a bounded, opt-in workaround for capturing real
    per-track data, not a fix to the timer/scheduling model. Flagged open in
    docs/findings/04-coldfire-dsp-link.md.

    BUDGET is a cap, not a fixed cost: a code hook on KIT_LOAD_FN stops the
    run as soon as it fires, so a generous budget does not slow down a
    capture where the event already happened early. If it never fires
    within BUDGET, this returns the PC reached anyway -- the caller's own
    capture proceeds exactly as it would have with pre_instrs=0, just having
    spent BUDGET instructions first.
